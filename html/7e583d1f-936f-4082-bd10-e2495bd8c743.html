The main focus of the redesign is speed, stability, and ease of use. It will also involve a style refresh. One very significant change we are hoping to introduce is the removal of Disqus for our commenting platform and a reversion back to standard Listverse comments as we had in the beginning. This will mean that some users will need to register new accounts but we hope it will be worthwhile in the end.</p> <p>With the new commenting system comes the possibility of adding social features – like following commenters or authors you like, building your own Listverse profile page, etc. Is this something you would use?</p> <p>It is very important to me to get your feedback in advance so I know what other areas we should be focussing on and even on new features you might like to see added. Do you want a daily news summary? Do you want competitions as in the past? Do you want book reviews? More Youtube videos? Less Youtube videos? No matter how far out your idea, let us know in the comments.</p> <p>This is also a great opportunity for you to ask for more lists of a particular category – or an entirely new category entirely. Do you want more unsolved mysteries? More animal lists? More crime lists? More history lists? Or are we publishing too many lists in some categories that you don’t like?</p> <p>Also, while I have your attention, over the last few days I have been systematically removing adverts from the site and cleaning up some of the code in the background. Google Analytics is reporting that this has had a major impact on page load times but still not enough to satisfy me (hence the redesign). It should also have had the effect of removing some of the bugs people have noticed in the past. If there are any issues plaguing the site, let me know here.</p> <p>In summary here are the questions I’d most like to see answered:</p> <p>1. What new feature would you most like us to add?<br/> 2. What list categories do you want more or less of?<br/> 3. What would make you share the lists with your social media friends?<br/> 4. Are three lists enough or do you want to see more?<br/> 5. Would you like to see more social functionality added to the site?</p> <p>Your comments will be given to our redesign team so it would also be helpful if you could upvote any other comments that you agree with to help us get a good idea of the overall opinion on things.</p> <p>Now: fire away and don’t hold back!</p>
