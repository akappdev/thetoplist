We have had some excellent submissions already but there is always room for more. Because of a delay in the implementation of the new design, the competition has been extended from the 24th to the 27th of this month, with the launch hopefully occurring in the first week of October. Be sure to enter to win one of the great prizes!</p> <p>For more details on the competition, check the original post here.</p>
