This mixed list is of the top 10 bathroom scenes in movies.</p> <p>15. Austin Powers</p> <p>[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-YVt4gfquA&amp;rel=1]</p> <p>No list is complete without Austin.</p> <p>14. The Sweetest Thing</p> <p>[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=carl7XIaqxQ&amp;rel=1]</p> <p>Glory holes and poetry.</p> <p>13. Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo</p> <p>[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBhlyXQeAL0&amp;rel=1]</p> <p><strong>[WARNING: This clip contains obscene language]</strong> Unfortunately I could not find the actual scene from this movie. In this film, Deuce is called on to save a fish from a toilet. As he is plunging, sounds of a sexual nature begin to come through the wall. Deuce matches the tempo with the plunger to prevent the little boy who owns the fish from hearing it. At the “right moment”, a piece of feces flies out of the toilet and lands in the fish bowl. As I couldn’t find the scene on youtube, I have included the famous “Tourette Syndrome” scene – hilarious. For another toilet scene, this time from Deuce Bigalow European gigalo, you can view this clip on youtube.</p> <p>12. Dumb and Dumber</p> <p>[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_UgnqOgqUE&amp;rel=1]</p> <p>Simply put – ex lax and a broken toilet.</p> <p>11. White Chicks</p> <p>[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiLme0Wayso&amp;rel=1]</p> <p>This is what happens when a lactose intolerant person eats quiche.</p> 10. Something About Mary <p>[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i26tJWhDgxQ&amp;rel=1]</p> <p>In this interesting scene we see Ben Stiller “preparing” himself for a date. Unfortunately the clip is in Italian, but you don’t need to understand the language to understand the humor.</p> <p>9. Royal Tenenbaums</p> <p>[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pyBB7y8fDU&amp;rel=1]</p> <p><strong>[WARNING: This clip contains disturbing images of suicide]</strong> We have seen this one on the site before – a very disturbing yet beautiful scene.</p> 8. Rules of Attraction <p>[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GAwi34vHyQ&amp;rel=1]</p> <p><strong>[WARNING: This clip contains disturbing images of suicide]</strong> More disturbing than the last – I will never hear this song in the same light again.</p> <p>7. Pulp Fiction</p> <p>[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88aa3E0z-7A&amp;rel=1]</p> <p>The end of Vincent.</p> <p>6. Something About Mary II</p> <p>[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1Yv0gH3Fxc&amp;rel=1]</p> <p>I know it is another one from this film – but I had to include this scene. Sorry for the sound quality.</p> 5. Naked Gun <p>[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzGe5hkmDb4&amp;rel=1&amp;border=0]</p> <p>In this scene, Leslie Nielson uses the toilet – forgetting he is wearing a microphone which is broadcasting every sound to a hall full of people gathered to honor the Queen of England.</p> <p>4. American History X</p> <p>[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoFiTcBYsiI&amp;rel=1]</p> <p>An emotional scene from a great movie.</p> <p>3. Psycho</p> <p>[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdrDpELNbks&amp;rel=1]</p> <p>The most famous shower scene in history.</p> <p>2. Full Metal Jacket</p> <p>[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q3jk2om9GE&amp;rel=1]</p> <p>An amazing scene – contains violence.</p> <p>1. Trainspotting</p> <p>[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XrvpEIiC1w&amp;rel=1]</p> <p>I am guessing that most people would be expecting to see this one on the list. It definitely has to take position 1.</p> <p>Notable Omissions: Eyes Wide Shut</p>
