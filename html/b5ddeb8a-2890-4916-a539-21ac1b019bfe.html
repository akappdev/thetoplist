The first two lists have proven to be so popular that it seemed appropriate to do another. Some of the items on this list have come from suggestions in comments on various posts on this site and discussions on other sites. Thanks to all for the suggestions. So here, completing our trilogy, are 10 more bizarre videos. WARNING: There are scenes of horror in the videos below.</p> <p><strong>1. Begotten – Elias Merhige</strong></p> <p>Merhige is an American avant garde film director. This is the full version of his cult film Begotten. It starts to get really weird around 1 minute 50 in. I warn you – this is pretty hideous. The film opens with God killing himself with a straight-razor.</p> <p><strong>2. Eraserhead – David Lynch</strong></p> <p>This is a snippet of one of David Lynch’s early films. It was made in 1977 and it is a surrealist horror film which has become a cult classic.</p> <p><strong>3. Rubber Johnny – Chris Cunningham and Aphex Twin</strong></p> <p>This has to be the most asked for clip so far. Cunningham is an acclaimed English music video director. This is a short film he made with music by Aphex Twin. He has also directed music videos for Bjork.</p> <p><strong>4. I’ve Plummed this Whole Neighbourhood – Nurse with Wound</strong></p> <p>Nurse With Wound or NWW is the main recording vehicle of British musician Steven Stapleton. NWW was originally a band, formed in 1978 by Stapleton, John Fothergill and Heman Pathak. This unusual clip features some very strange sounds accompanied by a bizarre video clip.</p> <p><strong>5. Holy Mountain (trailer) – Alejandro Jodorowsky</strong></p> <p>Holy Mountain is a cult film by Chilean Alejandro Jodorowsky. This film was entirely financed by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. At a projected budget of $1,500,000 (in USA dollars), it is the most expensive Mexican film production to date.</p> <p><strong>6. Taiwanese Alien Baby</strong></p> <p>This is a real human baby suffering from a terrible disorder called harlequin ichthyosis. Sufferers of the disease are known as Harlequin Babies. Awful.</p> <p><strong>7. Thrift Store – Shaye St. John</strong></p> <p>Shaye St. John is a mulit-media performance artist. This is one of his performances which is, frankly, weird.</p> <p><strong>8. Le Reour a la Raison – Man Ray</strong></p> <p>Man Ray was an American modernist artist who contributed significantly to the Dada and Surrealist movements. He lived mainly in Paris.</p> <p><strong>9. The Clergyman and the Seashell – Antonin Artaud</strong></p> <p>This is an early film of the Artaud surrealist play of the same name. Artaud is most famous for his Theatre of Cruelty in which the actors accompanied by sounds attempted to shock the audience. They were successful in most cases causing members of the audience to be sick, or to faint.</p> <p>Part 2 can be found here, and part 3 here.</p> <p><strong>10. Variations V – John Cage</strong></p> <p>Cage was an experimental American composer. In this performance of Variations V we also see Merce Cunningham – he was Cage’s lover and frequent collaborator. The musical score was composed by flipping coins to determine each element and it also involved photo-cells and tape recorders.</p> <p>This list is three in the trilogy. The first two are the Top 10 Bizarre Videos, and Another 10 Bizarre Videos. As always, if you can suggest more, do so in the comments.</p> <p>Technorati Tags: Bizarre, videos, Weird</p>
