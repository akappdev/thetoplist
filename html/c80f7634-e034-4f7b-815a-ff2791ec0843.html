Therefore I am very please to introduce this one! I’d like to emphasize that this is NOT a top ten best list! Rather, it’s simply a list of some great jazz performances and is more of an overview of different jazz styles. Aside from trying to add a diverse selection of jazz styles, any song making the cut into the list had to have a Youtube video with film footage rather than a picture montage with song accompaniment.</p> 10 <p>Ain’t got no... (I got life)</p> <p>Nina Simone</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUcXI2BIUOQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1]</p> <p>Nina Simone has dabbled in all the jazz genres, and this a little taste of her acid jazz stylings. It’s not lyrically or instrumentally challenging but it’s fun to listen to her sing “My boobies!” I recommend not singing that aloud randomly in public places unless you’re used to receiving odd looks from strangers...</p> 9 <p>‘Round Midnight</p> <p>Thelonious Monk</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX_mwDvcZ2I&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1]</p> <p>‘Round Midnight is a staple for the late night jazz radio stations. This was originally composed by Thelonious Monk but has had such an influence on the jazz world that nearly every jazz musician has performed his or her own interpretation of the piece.</p> 8 <p>Sing Sing Sing </p> <p>The Benny Goodman Orchestra</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mJ4dpNal_k&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1]</p> <p>Does this song need an introduction? It is fairly well known because of swing music’s mainstream revival through bands like The Brian Setzer Orchestra and Cherry Poppin’ Daddies. If you listen to this version and that of more recent takes on the song, you’ll notice that not much has changed; it’s hard to fix perfection!</p> 7 <p>Darn that Dream</p> <p>The Ahmad Jamal Trio</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qc3VaXtW5M&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1]</p> <p>Ahmad Jamal is one of the best jazz pianists to ever touch the keys. He has been a professional musician for over 50 years now working with the likes of Stan Gentz, Sarah Vaughn and Miles Davis. Let it be noted that the performance in the video clip is entirely improv.</p> 6 <p>A lovely way to spend an evening </p> <p>June Christy and Stan Kenton</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvfNsZaDk-A&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1]</p> <p>June Christy’s star power was eclipsed by the likes of Sarah Vaughn and Ella Fitzgerald so she’s relatively unknown to the casual jazz listener. However, she’s an icon in the cool jazz genre and is often credited with being the original style influence for many modern day jazz singers. In the early part of her career, she sang for Stan Kenton’s orchestra but her style really took off when she went solo. This performance took place just prior to her retirement from the music industry.</p> 5 <p>Assorted song clips</p> <p>The Quintette of the Hot Club of France</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsHyO7KyhME&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1]</p> <p>Thanks to Pixar, gypsy jazz seems to be reemerging in mainstream popularity. Guitarist Django Reinhardt and violinist Stephen Grapelli are the most famous gypsy jazz artists and they both happen to play for this quintet. Be careful with your volume; shortly after the 4 minute mark, the sound quality becomes very bad and very loud.</p> 4 <p>Manteca</p> <p>Dizzy Gillespie</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1s5CWbYyao&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1]</p> <p>Afro-Cuban jazz blends New Orleans jazz style with Latin rhythms. It’s usually much more structured than other jazz genres but has a light-hearted rhythm that’s great to dance to, whether it’s fast-paced like Dizzy Gillespie’s “Manteca” or slower like the bossa nova styled song “Sway”.</p> 3 <p>So What</p> <p>Miles Davis &amp; John Coltrane</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4TbrgIdm0E&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1]</p> <p>This piece is one of the best songs in one of the best albums created in any jazz genre. The entire album is worth listening to. Without going too deeply into music theory, most improv styles prior were fixed within a chord set (i.e. specific musical notes) but Miles Davis tried a new technique (modal jazz) that vastly opened up the range and allowed for more musical liberties.</p> 2 <p>One for my Baby</p> <p>Sammy Davis Jr.</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeDaNGzUYM8&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1]</p> <p>This is a great way to cram in as many jazz musicians as possible into this list! Sammy Davis, Jr. did a remarkable job mimicking each singer’s style and mannerisms. The impressions done include Fred Astaire, Nat ‘King’ Cole, Billy Eckstine, Vaughn Monroe, Tony Bennett, Mel Tormé, Louis Armstrong, Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis...and of course, a little bit of Sammy Davis, Jr.</p> 1 <p>What a Wonderful World</p> <p>Louis Armstrong</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnRqYMTpXHc&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1]</p> <p>This is one of the more commonly known jazz songs as numerous musicians have covered the song and it has also played in many television shows and movies. Like the bluesy “Strange Fruit” by Billie Holiday, this was meant as an anti-racism song but unlike “Strange Fruit”, it takes on a hopeful outlook for change in the future.</p>
