Some are bad, some are mediocre, but none are good! Here is the list of top 10 celebrity commercials.</p> 10. Elijah Wood Pizza Hut <p>I don’t think Elijah has grown much since making this commercial. The best part is when he throws a pile of what appears to be mashed potatoes in his sister’s face!</p> <p>9. Jodie Foster McDonald’s Commercial</p> <p>Jodie doesn’t do much in this clip – but she is definitely there. I must say – the guy playing Ronald is a bit scary – how the hell did McDonald’s succeed as a company with a mascot like that?</p> 8. Meg Ryan Aim Toothpaste <p>Here is a very preppy Meg Ryan lending her Aim mint to two friends. Ra ra ra!</p> <p>7. Matt Leblanc Heinz Ketchup</p> <p>Here we have a younger, but still cheesy, Matt Leblanc. Love the wink!</p> <p>6. Keanu Reeves Corn Flakes</p> <p>Can’t act now, couldn’t act then – it’s Keanu Reeves setting up a table for breakfast and having a sneaky nibble himself.</p> 5. Leonardo DiCaprio Bubble Yum <p>Even as a kid Leonardo DiCaprio had a very serious face. Here we see him comparing the bang from Bubble Yum with the beats from a boombox. Ah, the eighties.</p> <p>4. Brad Pitt Pringles</p> <p>My guess is that Brad was not chosen for this part for his acting skills.</p> <p>3. Demi Moore Diet Coke</p> <p>When Demi made this commercial, she had already starred in a few films, though the only truly notable one was St. Elmo’s Fire. Despite what I said in the first paragraph, this actually is quite a funny commercial.</p> <p>2. Morgan Freeman Listerine</p> <p>Despite the ad being very corny, Morgan Freeman is not all that bad here! Who would have known he would go on to such great things?</p> <p>1. Bruce Willis Seagrams</p> <p>Not only does Bruce Willis sing in this advert, he dances! Watch out for the ballet move at about -00:12.</p> <p>Bonus: Sarah Michelle Gellar Burger King</p> <p>Sarah Michelle Gellar is almost unrecognizable in this commercial.</p>
