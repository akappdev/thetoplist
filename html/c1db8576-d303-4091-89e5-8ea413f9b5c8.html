Fortunately, as the avid animal lover I am, I had saved the links to several interesting videos and it was only a matter of putting the best all together. I hope you enjoy them! <strong>WARNING</strong>– Some of these videos may be disturbing for very sensitive people, although I doubt it; also, for some reason, You Tube users often edit videos and put music tracks instead of the original audio; often, the result is abysmal. I apologize about that. </p> <p></p> <p><strong>1. Orcas hunt seal as “training”, then let it go.</strong></p>  <p>Adult orcas in Antarctica causes a crab-eating seal to fall off the ice by throwing giant waves at it, then return the seal to the ice instead of killing it. They were seemingly teaching their young how to hunt seals, but saw no need to kill the seal at the moment. </p> <p><strong>2. Warthog fights lioness off.</strong></p>  <p>A young warthog defends itself against a much bigger lioness.

Crocodile bites man’s arm</strong></p>  <p>A man teases a crocodile and obviously gets bitten; the croc then does the infamous “death roll” trying to tear the arm off. More than admiring the “bravery” of the guy, I admire the crocodile’s patience...</p> <p><strong>10. Christian the lion’s story</strong></p>  <p>A very touching story of a lion raised by humans and then succesfully reintroduced into the wild. Rather famous story by now...</p> <p></p> <p><strong>11.
