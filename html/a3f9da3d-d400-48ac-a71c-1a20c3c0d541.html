The thing I like most about this contributed list is that all of the films on it are exceptional movies and I would not hesitate to recommend any one of them to my friends. Be sure to add others that you like to the comments.</p>  10 <p>Play Misty For Me</p> <p>1971</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFLwJpW6cDw&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p><strong>The Disorder:</strong> Borderline Personality Disorder</p> <p>Disc jockey Dave Garver attracts the amorous attentions of a demented fan named Evelyn Draper. Evelyn lets Dave pick up at a bar; later at her apartment, Evelyn admits that she is the cooing caller who repeatedly asks Dave to play the Erroll Garner classic “Misty.” From then on, the film is a lesson in how one casual date can turn your whole life around. Evelyn stalks Dave everywhere, ruins his business lunch, assaults his maid, mutilates his house and all of his belongings, and finally threatens to butcher his girlfriend Tobie Williams. You’ll never be able to hear that song again without looking over your shoulder. </p> <p></p> 9 <p>Through a Glass Darkly</p> <p>1961</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwu80rk5xds&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p><strong>The Disorder:</strong> Schizophrenia</p> <p>A young woman, Karin, has recently returned to the family island after spending some time in a mental hospital.
