The idea first popped up in the site forums and shortly after a webdesigner suggested that we get a logo and update the pages a little. I would also love to do some merchandise – I really want a listverse cup! So we are now officially launching the Logo Competition.</p> <p>The Prize</p> <p>The prize for the winning logo will be a <strong>$200</strong> Amazon.Com voucher or $200 in cash – whichever is preferred by the winner – and the joy of seeing your logo on the top of every page of the site!</p> <p>Competition Terms</p> <p><strong>1.</strong> The logo must be original work of the submitter.<br/> <strong>2.</strong> The logo should be vector graphics or submitted as a PSD.<br/> <strong>3.</strong> The logo should be usable in monochrome and color media, including limited colors (say 2 or 3 colors).<br/> <strong>4.</strong> The logo must not exploit or offend anyone’s sex, race, religion, morality, culture, nor be salacious, or pornographic.<br/> <strong>5.</strong> The logo should be simple and should be usable as a mascot for the site. Remember that this will be going on merchandise.<br/> <strong>6.</strong> You can create a mascot which does not include the name of the site (or any text for that matter) – but if you do please suggest and demonstrate a font and style to be used with your mascot on the site.</p> <p>It would be preferable to use the colors on the site as a guide because I am planning to retain our color scheme when we update our design.
