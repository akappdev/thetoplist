So many people are frightened to the point of getting the ever-awful willies from just seeing a bug, that Hollywood has taken this proverbial ball and run with it. Since the horror genre hit the screens back in the 1940’s, the bug movie has been a staple of the industry. Here are the top ten most watched and, for the most part, loved.</p> 10. Them (1954) <p>Perhaps the forerunner to the giant bug franchise, in this film we find a group of massive ants ruining more than just a picnic.</p> <p>9. Eight-Legged Freaks (2002)</p> <p>David Arquette. Kari Wuhrer. A tag line that states, “Do you hate spiders? Do you REALLY hate spiders? Well they don’t like you either” GOLD.</p> 8. Deadly Mantis (1957) <p>What happens when some incredibly idiotic scientists discover a prehistoric chunk of a long-frozen praying mantis? Death, what else.</p> <p>7. Ticks (aka INFESTED) (1993)</p> <p>Want to see Clint Howard (primarily useless brother of Ron) shout, “I’M INFESTED!”? Then I guess you need to see this.</p> <p>6. Black Scorpion (1957)</p> <p>Yet another in the eventual stock that was razzed incessantly by the geniuses at Bad Brains... of course I refer to one of the best shows ever, Mystery Science Theater 3000. Oh, and this trailer will show you why.</p> 5. Starship Troopers (1997) <p>Casper VanDien and a giant vagina-bug? You bet!</p> <p>4. A Bugs Life (1998)</p> <p>Animated bugs are talking and doing human-llike stuff! Everybody run!</p> <p>3. Slither (2006)</p> <p>When Michael Rooker gets bitten and transforms into a giant, oozing, super-quick bug from space... oh, and then impregnates a local who ends up bigger than a barn, you know you’re in for a classic adventure!</p> <p>2. Arachnophobia (1990)</p> <p>Jeff Danials and John John Goodman got to war on a slew of toxic spiders wreaking havoc on a little town. Just seeing the guy pinned under a wine rack launching a nail at a flaming arachnid is worth the price of admission.</p> <p>1. The Fly (1986)</p> <p>David Cronenberg re-makes the original with a far-superior and much stronger cast as well as amping up the gruesomeness. Jeff Goldblum and Gena Davis supply the ability to really feel how it could be to transform so fully into a hiddeous beast.</p> <p>Naked Lunch, Swarm, Dune</p> <p>Contributor: StewWriter</p> </body></html>
