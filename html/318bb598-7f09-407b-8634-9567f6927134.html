As part of this project we are reorganizing our list categories and adding a new feature which will enable you to tag a list with a certain emotional tag. To help us work out the best words and order of these new features we have created two surveys. It would help us a huge amount if you would take the time to answer them for us. You do not need to enter any personal information â€“ you just have to tick the appropriate boxes.</p> <p>Survey for Emotional Response Words<br/> Survey for New Listverse Categories</p> <p>I am also very excited to announce the winner of our November writing contest. LordZB was chosen at random for his list Top 10 Bizarre Marriages. Congratulations! Even though our writing competition is over, Listverse is still paying $100 for every list selected for publication. So put pen to paper and get writing for Listverse!</p>
