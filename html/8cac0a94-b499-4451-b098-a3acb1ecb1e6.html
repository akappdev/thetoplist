They have influenced music genres from contemporary to progressive rock. Floyd was innovative with their music and helped create a new progressive space rock feel. With elaborate art work on their album covers and live concerts that had floating pigs and lasers, Pink Floyd gave new meaning to the word psychedelic. A list of Top 10 Pink Floyd Songs has already done which resulted in a lot of hurt for missing songs, so without further ado, here is an additional 10 Pink Floyd songs. </p>  10 <p>Fearless</p> <p>(Gilmour, Waters) – Meddle 1971</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCgQuj8v2gg&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>Repeated within this amazing song are lyrics from “You’ll Never Walk Alone”, which is a song from the musical Carousel. It is from a recording of Liverpool fans signing “You’ll Never Walk Alone” at a soccer match.</p> <p></p> 9 <p>Sheep</p> <p>(Waters) – Animals 1977</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6U4XakchT0&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>What is interesting about this song is the rumor that there is a subliminal message within the song itself. It is supposed to be a different version of the Lord’s Prayer: “The Lord is my shepherd, He converteth me to lamb cutlets....” (I have not been able to confirm this even when I listen to the song myself, although I would love to hear it.)</p>  8 <p>Money</p> <p>(Waters) – Dark Side of the Moon 1973</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkhX5W7JoWI&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>Although this song is making fun of money, Pink Floyd sold over 34 million copies of this album. This was written by Waters, but sung by Gilmore. In the 2006 Dark Side of the Moon tour, Roger Waters sang all the songs from the album but “Money” due to this. </p> <p></p> 7 <p>Have a Cigar</p> <p>(Waters) – Wish You Were Here 1975</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUDpc04r_QM&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>Favorite line from this song: “The band is just fantastic, that is really what I think. Oh by the way, which one’s Pink?” That line was asked by many people to the band throughout Pink Floyd’s music career. This song goes to show how far corporations and agencies will go to exploit their clients, especially with the phrases like “You’re gonna go far” and “Riding the Gravy Train”.</p> <p></p> 6 <p>Poles Apart</p> <p>(Gilmour, Samson, Nick Laird-Clowes) – The Division Bell 1994</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfW1FdTnQJ0&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>What better name to give to the rift between Syd Barrett and Roger Waters then the name of this song. Many believe the first part of this song is targeted to Barrett and the second part about Waters. Clearly, it was about the miscommunication that occurred between them.</p>  5 <p>Learning to Fly</p> <p>(Gilmour, Anthony Moore, Ezrin, Jon Carin) – Momentary Lapse of Reason 1987</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb-Nacm-pKc&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>Gilmour was quoted in saying “‘Learning to Fly’ is about breaking free and the actual mechanics of learning to fly an airplane.” This was true since he would go on to get his pilot’s license, despite the rumor that he was terrified of flying.</p> <p></p> 4 <p>Astronomy Domine</p> <p>(Syd Barrett) – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (UK release) 1967</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5Tne92jfxo&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>To many, this song is what started the space rock genre. It also dealt with the ‘space race’ between countries to gain control of outer space. Pink Floyd’s philosophical powers at work.</p> <p></p> 3 <p>Brain Damage/Eclipse</p> <p>(Waters) – Dark Side of the Moon 1973</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uf-ArgakvZI&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>(Two for the price of one.) As with the album The Wall, Dark Side of the Moon had songs that played and flowed into one another, creating a ‘one long song’ feel. By themselves, Brain Damage and Eclipse are excellent pieces of music, but are better played together as they compliment each other.</p> <p></p> 2 <p>Welcome to the Machine</p> <p>(Waters) – Wish You Were Here 1975</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB_2oIKUVks&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>As with “Have a Cigar”, this song is about the ‘money-making machine’ that is the music industry. With clever lyrics such as “What did you dream, it’s alright we told you what to dream”, this song points at the industry’s lust for money rather than establishing talent. This was a bone of contention with not only Pink Floyd, but most of the artists of those days.</p> <p></p> 1 <p>Time</p> <p>(Gilmour, Waters, Wright, Mason) – Dark Side of the Moon 1973</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntm1YfehK7U&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>“Time” is an all time classic and deserving of the number one slot (based on the many comments from the first list). This song is largely based on the affect of life passing by and chances that are not seized along the way. All 4 members were given credit for writing this song. The intro of clocks chiming was a concept by engineer Alan Parsons who was attempting to introduce a new ‘quadraphonic sound system’. However, the band decided to use it for the opening of the song instead, with much more powerful results.</p> <p></p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_bvT-DGcWw&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>That’s right, the entire album. How can anyone just pick one? Whether you believe it’s the best of the best and has no equal or you feel that it’s overrated and overplayed, “The Wall” is easily the most recognized Pink Floyd album. With such songs as “Comfortably Numb”, “Run Like Hell”, “Hey You”, “In the Flesh” and “Another Brick in the Wall” this album had more notoriety than any other and can be considered as the number one album of Pink Floyd’s expansive musical legacy.</p> <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Did you know if you play the album for Dark Side of the Moon (started at the 3rd MGM lions roar) it runs with the Wizard of Oz?</p> <p>Notable admissions: I can’t fit them all in, but in order to keep to a top 10 list, these songs were regrettably cut: Dogs of War, One of These Days, The Great Gig in the Sky, See Emily Play and Interstellar Overdrive</p> </body></html>
