I have been visibly absent but I have been keeping my eye on things behind the scenes, though no where as much as I would have liked to. I am now present full time.</p> <p>If you have been reading the comments on the lists recently you will have noticed a number of readers asking for some changes and improvements around the place. This post is an opportunity for you to tell us exactly what sort of content you most want to see on the front page each day and what sort of content you don’t want to see.</p> <p>Pull no punches—this is a chance for me to get a better understanding of what I need to do to keep the site thriving and restore the golden days of LV prior to my departure.</p> <p>Feel free to use the up-votes if you agree with someone so I can get a good measure of what you are all wanting. This is also your chance to tell me if you have any issues with the site in general—issues around advertising, page load times, etc.</p>
