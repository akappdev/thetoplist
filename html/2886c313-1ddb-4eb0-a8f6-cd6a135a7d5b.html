While some of these artists may have had ongoing success in their musical careers – they each had only one really seriously big hit. As usual, add your own to the comments. NOTE: There is a US popularity bias in this list – due to the US population bias on this site – so please don’t bash me for including someone that was a major star in Hungary or similar!</p> <p>15. Rock me Amadeus Falco, 1985</p> <p>Rock me Amadeus was Falco’s only major hit in the United States, despite his popularity in Germany and his native Austria, and all over Europe.

They are best known for their 1982 #1 club and major pop hit, as well as subsequent dance anthem “It’s Raining Men”.

Kung Fu Fighting Carl Douglas, 1974</p> <p>This song remains one of the most fondly remembered one-hit wonders in the UK (though some dispute that it is a true one hit wonder as Douglas had two further hits that did not reach the Top 20).</p> <p>11. Groove is in the Heart Dee Lite, 1990</p> <p>An immediate smash in nightclubs, the song crossed over to pop radio and after going to number one on the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart, it eventually hit number four on the Billboard Hot 100.
