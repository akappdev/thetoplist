This is a list of the ten greatest movie speeches. Obviously many of you will disagree with my selection, so feel free to add your own to the comments. Include a youtube link if you can so we can all enjoy the goods!</p> 10. Matt Damon’s Speech Good Will hunting <p>Pride comes before a fall and in this scene – we see a perfect example of it. This is a wonderful scene that anyone who has ever made mocked will appreciate. I especially like the way he wraps things up with the offer to “step outside” – he may be a walking library, but he is also a badass!</p> <p>Buy this DVD at Amazon<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=jamifrat-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1"/></p> <p>9. Captain Koons Speech Pulp Fiction</p> <p>This has to be on the list simply because Christopher Walken is so amazing. You can easily see Tarantino’s writing in this speech, but Walken manages to take it to another dimension.</p> <p>Buy this DVD at Amazon<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=jamifrat-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1"/></p> 8. Monty Brogan’s Speech 25th Hour <p>A large number of items on this list have good messages in them – this one, unfortunately, is bound to offend virtually everyone. Nevertheless, the acting is good and Edward Norton is brilliant, so here it is.</p> <p>Buy this DVD at Amazon<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=jamifrat-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1"/></p> <p>7. A Few Good Men A Few Good Men</p> <p>My apologies for including a scene with Tom “Xenu’s Bitch” Cruise, but I had to include this scene because Jack Nicholson is so great.</p> <p>Buy this DVD at Amazon<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=jamifrat-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1"/></p> <p>6. Courtroom Scene To Kill a Mockingbird</p> <p>A brilliant story and an almost equally brilliant film.
