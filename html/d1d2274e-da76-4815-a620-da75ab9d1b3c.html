After last weekâ€™s preliminary vote, the French must now select between socialist Emmanuel Macron (born 21 December 1977) and right-wing Marine Le Pen (born 5 August 1968).</p> <p>Before politics, Mr Macron was an investment banker at Rothschild &amp; Cie Banque, and Mrs Le Pen was a lawyer working mainly as a public defender.</p> <p>The question we present you today is: Who should be the next president of the Republic of France?</p> <p>Note that we are not asking who you think will win, but rather who you think <strong>should</strong> win. Who will be better for France in the long-term?</p> <p>Please remember to debate the facts not the person. Ad hominem attacks are the sign of a failed argument. There is no victory in name calling!</p>
