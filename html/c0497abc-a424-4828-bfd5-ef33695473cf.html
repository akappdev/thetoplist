Every year thousands of reports are made documenting experiences between people and large, hairy bipedal humanoids. These sightings occur all over the world. The creatures have many names, including Sasquatch, Yeti, Yowie, Yeren, Almas, Barmanou, Skunk Ape, Mande Barung, Ban-manush and Orang Pendek. In the last 25 years, a large number of organizations have been developed with the goal of scientifically proving the existence of Bigfoot. DNA hair samples, footprints, pictures and video evidence have been collected and examined in order to develop a profile of the creature. With the modern expansion of technology, the numbers of videos claiming to have captured Sasquatch are growing. </p> <p>Many of the clips include short and often times shaky images. The creatures are always hiding from the camera. It appears that they are highly skilled at stealth activity. In many Bigfoot videos, the person with the camera doesn’t notice the Sasquatch until viewing the tape later. Another common type of clip shows a Bigfoot examining human activity, only to become frightened by a loud noise. The creature is then filmed running away. Sasquatch videos are always characterized by the figure watching the filmmaker. As we move into the 21st century, Internet buzz has been circulating around an upcoming Bigfoot documentary, and the possibility of proving the creatures existence. This article will focus on the top 20 unexplained Sasquatch videos. </p> <p>In many Bigfoot clips, the event lasts only a couple seconds and it can be hard to see everything in the scene. This can make it impossible to review the action, so the videos included have a helpful detailed analysis to guide you through the scene. It should be noted that the existence of Bigfoot is currently not accepted by the scientific community. Many people on the Internet immediately dismiss all photographic and video evidence, often times claiming a hoax. Some videos are just blurry. “I think Bigfoot is blurry. That is the problem. It’s not the photographers fault. Bigfoot is blurry. There is a large out-of-focus monster roaming the countryside.”</p> <p></p>  <p>Let’s begin the article with a preview for the upcoming Sasquatch documentary prepared by the Erickson Project. In 2005, a Canadian man named Adrian Erickson began a large field study of Sasquatch in both Canada and the USA. The project has the ultimate goal of getting Bigfoot recognized as a species or sub-species. The release of the documentary will coincide with the DNA findings of Dr. Melba Ketchum. The film has made an appearance on the list because of the hype surrounding the never before seen Bigfoot footage and encounters. Adrian Erickson has been purchasing Sasquatch videos for strict use in the film. One example is a 2005 clip featuring a juvenile Bigfoot feeding on pancakes. The clip was shot in Kentucky, and apparently shows a Bigfoot eating for several seconds. </p> <p>At the end of the video, a hand comes into the screen and pulls the juvenile Sasquatch away. The footage was eventually leaked to the Internet and created controversy. Like any good Bigfoot video, the public was widely interested. The owner of the clip immediately had it removed from the Internet and sold it to Adrian Erickson for $20,000. It has been suggested that the clip will be seen in the upcoming documentary. Rumors have also been swirling around an unseen Bigfoot clip that might be used in the film. Certain blogs have placed the quality of the clip above the famous Patterson-Gimlin video. During the event, a collection of people in Kentucky witnessed a Bigfoot for 20-30 seconds. The footage was captured near a habituation site that was part of the Erickson documentary research. </p> <p>Nothing is clear, but it has been suggested that the footage consists of 15 separate clips, taken by a group of people. The most famous video is fourteen seconds long and shows a female Sasquatch looking back and forth. The clip is said to have captured a clear facial view of the creature. Features of the Bigfoot include a human-like nose, pink lips, a black tongue, pointed teeth, a prominent brow and deep set eyes. The Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO) has been collaborating with Animal Planet to create a new series titled Finding Bigfoot. The BFRO has been holding certain Sasquatch clips for the show. The six part series will begin airing on June 5, 2011. It will include a 2003 clip taken at Montana’s Glacier National Park that shows a Bigfoot running, and a video taken in Wisconsin of a large Sasquatch.</p> <p></p> <p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckdt2kZ6rYE</p> <p>In 2009, a Russian documentary was released on Bigfoot in Siberia. The film has become notable for the inclusion of a 3 second long clip that shows an unexplained hominoid. Siberia makes up 77% of Russia’s territory. The area encompassing much of the Eurasian Steppe, it extends eastward from the Ural Mountains to the watershed between Pacific and Arctic drainage basins, and southward from the Arctic Ocean to the hills of north-central Kazakhstan and the national borders of both Mongolia and China. The mountain ranges of Siberia have a long history of Sasquatch encounters and modern day sightings.</p> <p>What to Look For</p> <p>The video shows a large humanoid figure that strongly resembles the Sasquatch profile. It was filmed by an unnamed person. In the footage, the creature is spotted as the camera is moving away from the scene. The figure was not noticed in the clip until it was later reviewed. The object has a uniform color, a coned head, long arms, and a ridge down the spine with patches of no hair. Considering that the figure was not seen until a later date, it appears to display intelligent movement. As the camera is turned from the area, the Sasquatch then decides to walk away. The tape shows a quick sequence and has been highly criticized. However, the hominoid has the characteristic white feet and abnormal gait seen in other Sasquatch videos. It also appears to be walking with an inline step and is traveling along a strategic ridge.</p> <p></p> <p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oygx3OWEOLU</p> <p>In 2007, a man named Jim Holder and his son captured video of an unexplained hominoid walking in Estes Park, Colorado. Estes Park houses the headquarters for the Rocky Mountain National Park. Unfortunately, the clip was taken with a cell phone, which gives it poor viewing quality. The Bigfoot encounter was published in many Colorado newspapers with claims of a genuine Sasquatch video. However, upon release of the footage, Jim Holder and his family received a large amount of abuse over speculation that the tape was a fake.<br/> In the months following the release of the clip, the Holder family gave a public statement indicating that Jim had been hoaxed. The claims were made because it had been suggested that the creature’s penis is visible in the clip and that it is circumcised. The fact remains that the characteristics displayed by the figure are consistent with the Sasquatch profile. Many of the movements are unique and could not have been performed by a human male, even with his junk hanging out.</p> <p>What to Look For</p> <p>The clip shows an auburn colored Sasquatch taking 12 steps through the forest. As the figure crosses the woods, it makes a sudden stop behind a tree. The movement is intriguing because it appears that the creature performs a skilled tree peak. In the slowed down footage, the humanoid can be seen dropping down and peering around the tree from a lowered position. It then quickly rises and continues to walk away. </p> <p>At this point in the video, the long arm length and cupped hands of the Sasquatch are visible. It has a uniform color, a rise and fall step, a clear coned head and a visible mid-tarsal break. Similar to other Sasquatch videos, the creature displays tree hiding, peaking and grabbing. It has a clear compliant gait, which means that the figure walks with bent legs. As the front leg hits the ground, it is bent, unlike anything a human can perform. Before the footage was captured, Jim Holder described a collection of bizarre noises. He also reported looking into the creature’s dark shadowy eyes.</p> <p></p> 17 <p>Georgia Bigfoot in the Backyard</p> <p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0B2cw2nD3c</p> <p>In October of 2010, a video appeared on YouTube showing an encounter with a large humanoid creature. The clip was discovered by researcher Chris Noel with only 34 views. The video was taken by a 9-year-old boy in the U.S. state of Georgia. After witnessing the figure in the woods, the boy pulled out his camera and began filming the sequence. He used an HD flip camera to document the event. The HD quality of the video makes the encounter special. The high resolution allows for clear enlargement. It was the second recorded Sasquatch sighting on the property and the video contains some important evidence that will help authenticate other Bigfoot clips. </p> <p>What to Look For</p> <p>The video begins with a black colored creature walking down a hill on the opposite side of the family’s property. The humanoid can be seen raising its arm and grabbing a tree branch. After the creature is spotted, the boy in the video yells out “Hey Bigfoot” and the figure disappears for a quick second, seems to make a quick peak around a tree and retreats up the hill. Another interesting aspect of the clip is that the family’s dog can be heard making loud noises in the background and is clearly distraught. The creature is consistent with the Sasquatch profile.</p> <p>It has a uniform color, has a coned head, gray cupped hands, a clear inline step and a compliant gait. No scale measurements have been taken on the property. The most impressive aspect of the video is when the creature walks away from the scene. Similar to the Patterson-Gimlin video, the Sasquatch has light colored gray pads on the bottom of its feet known as Ostmans pads. The pads are one of the best pieces of evidence for the existence of Bigfoot and appear in many of the top videos. The term originates from a Sasquatch description made by a man named Albert Ostman in 1956, ten years before the first Bigfoot was captured on tape. </p> <p>Because of the HD quality of the video, the walking motion is among the best ever captured. The figure has a knock-kneed inline step with a slight twist in the upstep, which creates an up and down type motion when walking. The movement of the Bigfoot is consistent with other Sasquatch footage. The mid-tarsal break is also evident, meaning the creature has a flat, but flexible foot. The mid-tarsal break gives the Sasquatch mid-foot flexibility. So, unlike people, it can lift its heel separately and grab objects with its feet. Humans are the only primates to consistently lack a mid-tarsal break.</p> <p></p> 16 <p>Bigfoot Hunted by a Helicopter</p>  <p>On February 17, 2011, a video was posted to YouTube with the title ‘Bigfoot hunted by helicopter’. It was filmed at an unknown location and the original upload included the message “My husband and I took our kids target shooting. A helicopter was over our heads the entire time annoying us. We thought at first they were curious of why and what we were shooting. Later when we watched the video we noticed something that looked like Bigfoot running in the trees. We assume now the helicopter was hunting the Bigfoot.” Alright, let’s have a fun discussion about world governments destroying evidence of Sasquatch. </p> <p>If you dig into the Bigfoot archives, accounts do exist of helicopters and armed agents forcing people to recant certain Sasquatch statements. Some of the most famous conspiracy theories are based around natural catastrophes, such as large fires or volcanic eruptions. Throughout history, a large collection of Sasquatch sightings have occurred in the area surrounding Mount St. Helens in the U.S. state of Washington. On May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens experienced a catastrophic eruption, which was subsequently the deadliest and most economically destructive volcanic event in the history of the United States. The cleanup after the eruption was extensive and took years to complete. Part of the process included the removal of burned animal corpses.</p> <p>Conspiracy theorists have latched onto an account from an apparent helper in the cleanup, who saw one pile of bodies that was covered and heavily protected by armed guards. It is said that the man witnessed the removal of the animals with a large net, in which Sasquatch limbs were clearly visible. Another, more detailed, account has surfaced surrounding a fire that occurred in Nevada in the late 1990s. In the story, a collection of firefighters saved a heavily burned Sasquatch and gave it medical attention. The account says that the creature was seen wandering on all fours and immediately gave up when circled. It was then taken away in a van and never heard from again. The person claims to have been debriefed and heavily threatened by government officials.</p> <p>What to Look For</p> <p>The clip shows a boy who is being taught how to shoot a gun. The kid starts out by firing a .22 caliber rifle twice, and then switches to the more powerful shotgun. Immediately following the explosion of the shotgun, a black figure can be seen running across the background. A helicopter can also be heard throughout the video, and when the creature is seen, the sound of the helicopter gets louder. The video has some heavy implications regarding the intelligence of the creature. The hominoid makes no movement until it is scared by the shotgun. It seems that the creature was anticipating the sound of a .22 rifle and was thrown off by the explosion of the high powered gun.</p> <p>The frame by frame examination of the figure is interesting. After the shotgun is fired, it explodes with a quick lateral movement. Similar to other Bigfoot clips, the animal is fixed forward as it moves and displays peaking. The object appears to be extremely large and has some low hanging arms. It has a coned head, a uniform dark black color, displays lateral arm movement, and has an abnormal gait. The creature can be seen in a strategic and covered position, watching human activity. In the last couple frames of the video, the humanoid can be viewed switching from a two-foot stance to all fours. </p> <p>This is an impressive sequence and consistent with other Bigfoot clips that show Sasquatch traveling on all fours when startled. As the object moves across the screen, a large and sprawling jump can be observed. The jump is reminiscent of two famous Sasquatch videos. The 1996, Memorial Day footage captured in Washington State and a video titled Bigfoot in the backyard by a stream. The backyard video is a 36 second long clip of a juvenile Sasquatch running. In the footage, the creature shows incredible athletic ability. In my opinion, it is one of the top ten clips in existence and would be included in this article, except for the fact that it is not readily available for view on YouTube or any other site.</p> <p></p> 15 <p>New York Juvenile Sasquatch</p>  <p>One of the most well known Bigfoot videos was captured by Robert Pridgen, at Lembo Lake Campground in the U.S. state of New York. In 1996, a festival was being held at Lembo Lake, and a large collection of people gathered for camping and fun. One of the groups was filming around the fire and captured some bizarre behavior in the trees. The footage of the creature wasn’t discovered until six years after the event. In the clip, a figure can be seen lifting a smaller creature up into the tree. The larger object is on camera for 14 seconds, while the juvenile is visible for 44 seconds. The video gives a good analysis of the event and shows a stabilized version of the action.</p> <p>What to Look For</p> <p>The clip starts with a juvenile creature being lifted into the tree by a larger object. The figure can then be witnessed swinging in the tree and displays some incredible maneuvers. It can be seen moving around on the branches. After research was conducted, it has been confirmed that the smaller Sasquatch is approximately five feet tall. The most startling aspect of the clip is the creature’s long arms. No pets are allowed in the campground and the figure is out of place. The athletic ability of the animal is impressive. Many sightings of young Bigfoot have been reported high in the trees. However, the New York Sasquatch was the only video recorded until the 2010 Ontario, Canada incident. The clip is special because the action is not easily explained. </p> <p></p> <p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuimf0274fs&amp;feature=related</p> <p>The Great North is a 2001 documentary that was filmed in the IMAX format. The film is a representation of the famous Robert Flaherty documentary, Nanook of the North, which is a detailed account of the Inuit people who lived off the frigid landscape of the Arctic North. In Great North, Nanook’s grandson is the narrator. He takes the viewers on a great adventure through the rich majesty of the Canadian setting, along with the breathtaking and awesome landscape of the freezing, snow-covered environment. Great North looks at the long-standing traditions of the Inuit people, such as fishing and hunting. </p> <p>The documentary was filmed near Inukjuak, on Hudson Bay in northern Quebec and also in Ontario. Great North has gained notoriety for a brief clip of an unexplained animal shown 9 minutes and 18 seconds into the film. The creature can be seen running alongside a herd of caribou as they flee up a steep hill. The animal appears to be a solid black color and has a gorilla like stride. The footage was filmed in Ontario, Canada, where gorillas and chimpanzees do not live. The video was captured with an advanced IMAX camera that has the capacity to record and display images at a far greater size and resolution than conventional film systems.</p> <p>What to Look For</p> <p>For starters, the video that I have included shows a zoomed in version of the sequence. The original clip was taken at a much farther distance. In the original video, the creature is very small, but the capabilities of the camera allow for a clear expansion. The scene in question shows footage of a great caribou migration. In the background of the shot, not far from where the caribou are running across a large stream, a black figure emerges from an unseen ditch and runs parallel to the ungulates for a short distance, before ducking down and disappearing from view. The creature can then be seen making a 90 degree turn to the left and traveling up the hill.</p> <p>Similar to other Bigfoot videos, claims have been made that the original footage of the event has been suppressed from release. With the IMAX camera, it is possible to enlarge digital images with great clarity. Pictures of the creature could be produced with great precision, accuracy, and substantial detail. These images could then be shared with the public. However, the documentation of such evidence has not been released and may not suit the scientific world. Many different websites have identified the creature as a film crew member wearing a backpack who was discreetly positioned to direct the caribou herds. As the sun hits the figure, a much more detailed profile is made. As the creature drops out of sight, it can be seen touching the top of its head. The video remains controversial and could show a Sasquatch hunting for food in the great north. </p> <p></p>  <p>In 1996, a well known Sasquatch encounter was filmed in the U.S. state of Washington. It was captured by Lori Pate with a Hi-8mm video recorder. The clip is one of the most studied and scrutinized videos every taken. According to statements given by the witnesses, a series of loud vocalizations were heard for approximately five minutes prior to the figure being filmed running across the field. Before the clip begins, the humanoid was seen moving from the forest line to a position behind a large tree. Similar to other videos in this article, the slowed down analysis of the action is extremely important to help understand what is happening. It is not available on YouTube, but this included link has a clip with information provided by the Facebook Bigfoot organization.</p> <p>What to Look For</p> <p>The video starts with the camera panning in on a humanoid figure running across a large open wooded area. The creature appears to be moving at a fast speed and performs a large jump as it travels across the hill. A still image captured during the sequence is detailed. It shows a figure with a clear coned head, arms down to the knees, a brow ridge, gray hands and uniform black color. During the leap section of the video, it appears that the creature’s back leg performs a hyperextension of the foot, consistent with the mid-tarsal break and an animal that can pick objects up with its feet. </p> <p>It appears that the humanoid has a compliant gait, with a bizarre looking walking motion. The compliant gait becomes visible when the objects front leg bends during a step. When people walk or run our front legs are straight. The figure runs with an up and down motion and displays some serious arm swinging. In the footage, the humanoid can be seen disappearing behind a hill for a short amount of time and then reemerging from the opposite side. It then continues to walk into the forest. A strange occurrence happens at this point in the clip. It seems that the figure’s size grows by a substantial amount as it enters the woods. With the enlarged video, many details of the last sequence become identifiable. </p> <p>As soon as the hominoid is filmed emerging from behind the hill, it has a small object on its back, which appears to be a child. In a frame by frame analysis, the baby can be seen crawling up the larger creature’s back and standing on its shoulders, giving the original Bigfoot a taller appearance. The recovery of the child in the footage helps explain why the Sasquatch put itself at risk in open daylight. A recurring theme in many Bigfoot videos is the presence of a baby or family member. It has been determined that the figure in the Memorial Day footage is 5.3 feet tall. </p> <p></p>  <p>Myakka City is an unincorporated community in southeastern Manatee County, Florida, United States. In May of 2008, a video was taken in Myakka City that shows a large humanoid creature. The footage was posted to YouTube under the title ‘Three clips of Sasquatch’. Each clip shows a different portion of a Bigfoot encounter. The tape is similar to other Sasquatch videos, but no full body image is ever captured. For this reason, along with the fact that the footage was not posted in one continuous segment, it raises immediate concerns over authenticity. </p> <p>What to Look For</p> <p>The video begins with a figure sitting on the ground behind a large tree. The creature is well aware of the human presence and is getting ready to flee the scene. The first clip captures the humanoid rising to its feet. It is an explosive motion and the creature doesn’t use its hands to get up. As the figure rises, a frame by frame analysis gives good detail of the objects palm and facial profile. The second clip shows the Bigfoot slowly walking away. At this point, it becomes suspicious that the filmmaker can’t keep the camera still. However, the examined footage confirms a Sasquatch profile on many levels. </p> <p>The creature appears to perform a typical Bigfoot motion, walking with its palms backward and toes pointed down. It has an enormous gait, a coned head, and a 60% arm to body ratio. The hands are extremely long and show flexibility. They are also cupped, which is similar to other Sasquatch videos. The figure shows finger motion, has white palms, and displays a familiar hair ridge down the back. At one point in the film, the object’s hair can be seen transforming from black to brown as it hits the sun. The third clip shows the Bigfoot peaking around a tree and then walking away. The tree peaking and hiding behavior is highly consistent with Sasquatch encounters.</p> <p></p> <p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rdvdKgDucY</p> <p>Crimea is an autonomous republic of Ukraine located on the northern coast of the Black Sea, occupying the Crimean Peninsula. The Crimean Peninsula has a long history of Sasquatch folklore and modern day encounters. On March 18, 2011, a video was posted to YouTube by user SDNikitin that shows a humanoid creature walking in the woods of Crimea. The clip includes a description. This video was sent to me by a friend who said he was having a picnic in the woods when he witnessed an unexplained creature. He was scared to death by the sight and originally thought the object was visible because he was drunk, but later reviewed the tape.</p> <p>What to Look For</p> <p>In the first frames of the video, the creature can be spotted observing the action from a strategic position up a hill and behind a collection of trees. Similar to other Sasquatch films, the Bigfoot is extremely low to the ground and in stealth mode. Immediately after the camera is turned on the animal, it rises up and starts to walk away. The action is a bit shaky, but after stabilization, the profile of the Yeti becomes visible. The humanoid has a uniform auburn hair color with high shoulders. It displays a coned head, gray face, long arms, cupped hands, white on the palms, and a compliant gait with a bent leg walking motion. </p> <p>As the Sasquatch moves across the screen, it reaches up and grabs a tree. It has been hypothesized that the action helps the creature navigate the woods. In the footage, it becomes clear that the people who taped the figure were shaken by the event. The dialogue included in the video indicates that they immediately left the area following the sighting. Probably the best shot in the video is when the creature’s enormous backstep becomes visible. The walking motion is extremely unique and reminiscent of other Bigfoot encounters.</p> <p><br/> </p>  <p>This is a great opportunity for me to thank all of the people at the Facebook Sasquatch research organization. Without strict analysis of the videos, it can be difficult to understand what is happening in many Sasquatch clips. On May 10, 2011, which is six day prior to writing this article, an interesting video was posted on YouTube with the title ‘Big Foot Siting Alaska’. The clip currently has 2,000 views, which is extremely low. Being so recently discovered, the footage has not been analyzed by a Sasquatch professional. The clip was uploaded with the description “I was on a logging road in Ketchikan, Alaska, hiking with my friend when I saw it! </p> <p>Boy did my heart start racing!! It was about 40 yards from the road! I’m not sure if it knew I was there or not, because the noise of flowing water from the stream. It seemed to travel fast! It made my hair stand up!! At one point you can see a whitish yellow thing in its hand! I believe it was skunk cabbage. Not sure, but it is in bloom. You can see it jump and after that it just seems to disappear. There was a lot of brush and trees between it and I, I could not tell where it had gone. It was a scary sort of exciting feeling at the same time!! We went to search for tracks, but we found no prints. If there is a Bigfoot, Sasquatch, or Kushtaka, I swear I saw him!! </p> <p>What to Look For</p> <p>As the video starts, a large humanoid figure can be seen walking in the woods. It is hard to get a clear view in the beginning of the tape, but a coned head is evident at full speed. At 24 seconds in, the creature becomes clearly visible to the camera and has something white it its hand. However, the walking motion appears bizarre because its hands are raised, I can’t see the long arms. The figure has a uniform color and matted hair. In the best part of the video, the object can be seen entering a heavily brushed area. It disappears for about five seconds. You can see the object squat down and peak at the camera. The figure then makes a large leap down an embankment. The jump is truly a special moment in the footage. </p> <p>Scale measurements of the scene have not been taken, but the data is important. After the leap is made, I can’t locate the creature, but comments on YouTube have directed me towards a pair of eyes that become visible for one second at 1:02 in the footage. The picture might be the best evidence without strict analysis of the objects motion. The figure is located in the center of the image towards the bottom of the screen. In the still, a set a huge eyes and a coned head are clearly visible. It is crazy how low to the ground the creature appears. The evidence is highly consistent with other Sasquatch clips that show how large the eyes are. It has also been suggested that the footage shows two separate Sasquatch, one in the beginning of the clip and a second Bigfoot getting up and performing the leap.</p> <p></p> 9 <p>Baby Bigfoot in Craw of Tree</p> <p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvIT_KGxb_Y</p> <p>William Evans is a Sasquatch researcher who has been attempting to capture a family of Bigfoot on film. In 2007, Evans was working at a location in northern California. He is convinced that the creatures understand the dangers associated with a hand-held camera, so he has developed a method called dowsing, in which the camera is held at the hip. The baby Bigfoot video was taken with the camera located on his hip. The clip is short and apparently shows a baby Sasquatch hiding in the craw of a tree. It is claimed that two other Bigfoot are present in the video.</p> <p>What to Look For</p> <p>The video begins with William Evans walking towards a tree after witnessing a Bigfoot. The creature is unseen in the clip, but located next to the large tree. Evans then sees a baby figure located in the craw of a tree and pans the camera in on the object. By proportion, it is pretty big. When watching the video for the first time it is hard to identify the creature. Pause the clip at 1:12 and you can get a clear view of the baby’s face. It has its mouth open and the stick is covering a portion of the figures right eye. It is a short clip, as the filmmaker is said to have felt threatened. </p> <p>William Evans captured the footage by using a process in which he travels through the thick forests until he feels an unusual presence. He then scans the woods with a hip cam. The video has been called the closest and clearest face shot of a Sasquatch available to the public. The baby Sasquatch shows a brow ridge, a human nose, gray knuckles, and no whites in the eyes. Similar to other Sasquatch videos, it appears to have a small coned head and gray skin on the face. In the clip, the figures eyes and mouth can be seen moving. Evans has claimed that two other creatures were present at the scene. It is hard to see, but a Bigfoot shaped creature may be in a nearby tree.</p> <p><br/> </p> 8 <p>Sasquatch Swinging in a Tree</p> <p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEg5lof1_GU</p> <p>In July of 2010, two Bigfoot researchers were on location in southwest Ontario, Canada. They were capturing footage of the surrounding forest. At the time of the event, the group didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary. However, after reviewing their footage, a collection of figures can be seen swinging in the trees above. The motion is extremely fast. When watching the video at full speed, it is impossible to identify the objects without knowing what to look for. However, the footage was captured with a quality camera, which has the ability to strongly enhance the tape. In the clip, two adult Sasquatch can be seen making some unbelievable moves.</p> <p>What to Look For</p> <p>In order to gain a clear perspective on the video, it needs to be viewed at an enhanced size. In the clip, a large bipedal animal can be seen high up in the trees. In a frame by frame examination of the tape, the creature can be seen with four huge limbs. The figure first swings across an open area and then walks for a short distance in a tiptoe style stance. Researchers of the tape have claimed that the Bigfoot grabs a baby Sasquatch before making the swing. The figure can then be seen jumping to another tree and launching itself in an upside down motion to a branch. It then hangs with what appears to be another creature in its arms. The athletic ability of the objects is amazing and the clip explains some important Sasquatch tendencies. </p> <p>The Bigfoot observed has a uniform auburn hair color, a 60% arm length, and it displays an incredible size. The video gives prominence to the 1997 New York juvenile Sasquatch video, in which a figure is observed making some crazy moves in a tree. The footage indicates that Bigfoot is comfortable in trees and may use them as a hideout. The tiptoe action captured in the tape is bizarre and shows extreme stealth activity. The clip has gained prominence because multiple creatures can be identified. It is hard to see the baby Bigfoot. However, when the first Bigfoot jumps, another Sasquatch becomes visible to the left of the action. It appears that both creatures are reacting to the same stimulus. The two separate Sasquatch could be protecting a child or juvenile that was stationed in that area.</p> <p></p> <p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9cNQ-VFEds</p> <p>In 1994, a man named Paul Freeman captured a video of an unexplained hominoid. The clip was taken in the U.S. state of Washington and shows a large Bigfoot walking in front of the camera. The creature looks over at Paul Freeman and then disappears into the forest. Later in the clip, a second Sasquatch can be seen for a couple of seconds peering from behind a tree. It appears that the Bigfoot is holding a baby. The film was taken with a poor quality video camera. The images are blurry in comparison to modern day video capabilities. The size of the creature is huge and its appearance is similar to the figure captured in the Patterson-Gimlin film.</p> <p>What to Look For</p> <p>The clip starts with Freeman trying to control the camera while searching for an unexplained noise. Paul comments that he can hear the brush breaking and then the figure appears. It takes a couple large steps, pauses and then looks over in the direction of the camera. The Sasquatch then immediately turns downhill and fades away from the camera, when it reaches the brush, the Bigfoot squats behind a tree for a total of four seconds. During this time, it peaks around the brush and then continues to walk away. </p> <p>Later in the clip, a separate creature can be seen with what appears to be a baby in arm. The unexplained figure recorded in the video confirms on many aspects of the Sasquatch profile. This includes a uniform color, long arms, and a coned head. The animal has a clear pause in its step and abnormal gait. The hands are held back for balance when slow walking. The creature displays tree hiding and peaking behavior. It has the ability to squat and hide very quickly. Similar to other Bigfoot encounters, a Sasquatch family is present at the scene.

It is the 104th largest island in the world. In 2005, a student named Nathan Wiley and some friends were in the forest on Prince Edward Island filming a video for school. Wiley needed a clip in which a person was seen running from the woods. According to the filmmaker, as the boy in the clip was moving from the trees, a huge apelike creature emerged from the opposite side of the forest. The creature can be seen running across the screen at a high speed. It should be noted that the person in the video is not running from the Bigfoot, but rather filming a scene.</p> <p>What to Look For</p> <p>The circumstances surrounding the video are controversial. It was filmed for a student project in an area with few previous Bigfoot sightings. However, the tape confirms the Sasquatch profile on many levels. Similar to the famous Patterson-Gimlin tape, the Wiley clip would be difficult to replicate. In the video, the creature can be seen running at an estimated speed of 25-30 mph. The Bigfoot initially shows a quadrupedal stride and at the end of the clip it rises to bipedal stance. As we have seen in other Sasquatch videos, when a large Bigfoot gets startled, it will run on all fours for speed. The implication surrounding the clip is that the Sasquatch was watching the human activity and got startled when one of the kids started running. </p> <p>Another possibility is that the Sasquatch was running to the area vacated by the boy, possibly to protect a child or family member in that section of the forest. The creature in the video has a consistent black color, a 62% body to arm ratio, a coned head, gray skin on the face, and most importantly it shows incredible size and agility. The most important frame in the video is the last one. It shows the creature rising to a bipedal stance. The action is almost impossible to see without stabilization and zoom. If the clip was a hoax, this section would be the hardest to manufacture, especially since measurements of the creature can be taken. The Sasquatch appears to be approximately ten feet tall with huge shoulders.</p> <p><br/> </p> 5 <p>Marble Mountain Sasquatch</p> <p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVUPoBGJo1o</p> <p>The Marble Mountains are a sub-range of the Klamath Mountains, in northwestern California. The highest point is Boulder Peak at 8,299 feet (2,530 m). The mountains are protected by the Marble Mountain Wilderness Area. The 242,500-acre (981 km2) park is forested and contains 89 lakes stocked with trout. The area has many large streams and a plentiful ecosystem, including bear and deer. In July of 2000, a collection of fifteen hikers, many of them children with disabilities, went for a trip in the Marble Mountains near Fort Jones, California. The hikers carried a video camera on the journey. After finding some bizarre structures in the forest, including a den that was constructed out of large branches and twigs, the group turned the camera on. Minutes into the search, one of the teenage boys located a Bigfoot high on the ridge, over 750 yards from the hikers.</p> <p>What to Look For</p> <p>The Bigfoot is filmed for 3 minutes and 44 seconds as it walks down the mountain ridge. In order to get a clear view of the Sasquatch, the video has to be stabilized and enlarged, which is provided in the clip. After studying the film, it has become apparent that the creature does not act human. The body proportions are far too large and the limb movements are abnormal. The video confirms on almost every morphological point. After tree measurements were taken, the Bigfoot has been placed at over 8 feet (2.4m) tall. As the creature moves, an inline step is clearly visible. The humanoid can be seen making large movements very easily. </p> <p>The approximate size of the Bigfoot was achieved through the study of the exact path, along with trees and branches in the area. The best part of the video is when the Sasquatch realizes that a group of people have stumbled into its house. The creature begins to jump up and down, scream, push trees, and becomes visibility shaken. At this point, some important measurements can be taken, which give the Bigfoot a 60% arm length. The creature displays actions of disappointment, despair and frustration. After studying the tape, a coned head can be seen. Similar to other Sasquatch videos, a clear rise and fall walking motion is evident. The video is shot at a distance, but technology has allowed us to identify many non-human characteristics in the Marble Mountain Bigfoot. </p> <p></p>  <p>The Tatra Mountains are a range of mountains that form a natural border between Slovakia and Poland. They are the highest mountain range in the Carpathian Mountains. In the summer of 2009, a rock climber named Piotr Kowalski captured an unexplained humanoid creature in the Tatra Mountains. Piotr is quoted as saying, “I saw the huge ape-like form hiding behind the rocks. When I saw it, it was like being struck with a thunderbolt.” The footage is shocking and confirms a Sasquatch on multiple levels. </p> <p>The clip that has been included in this article shows the original footage with no analysis. A copy of the video with complete analysis is available through this link. It should be noted that the footage is said to contain pictures of an entire Sasquatch family. Similar to other Bigfoot videos, it is strange that the clip is shaky and moves away from the best shot. However, the action is highly consistent with the profile of Sasquatch. The video includes some bizarre events that remain unexplained. </p> <p>What to Look For</p> <p>It is not clear in the footage unless you watch the analyzed video, but when Kowalski begins taping, he pans the camera towards a large rock that shows head movement. As the camera moves up the hill, a second creature becomes clearly visible. The humanoid is captured moving down the hill. After examination, the creature appears to have a uniform color, a coned head and extremely long arms. It displays a fully functional hand, thumb, elbow and arm movements. After heading down the hill, the camera spins up to capture the creature bent over and getting ready to move. The clip is reminiscent of similar Sasquatch videos, especially the figure filmed in the Great North documentary that appears to have a large sloped back. </p> <p>The Yeti can be seen taking a huge step and walking behind a rock. The mid-tarsal break and rise and fall motion are clearly evident. The figure has cupped hands, a brow ridge and bulging muscles. In the analyzed video, it is mentioned that a third Sasquatch may be visible in the clip. It is very hard to see, but once you become aware of its position, the figure is truly bizarre. In the footage, the creature appears next to the feet of the Sasquatch. It is an auburn colored Bigfoot. The object is positioned low on the rocks and could be the reason the family was caught out in the open.</p> <p></p>  <p>The east Texas woodpile thermal video might be the best recorded evidence for the existence of Sasquatch. Christopher Noel is an educated professional who became interested in a series of Bigfoot encounters on a property in east Texas. In 2008, a collection of sightings occurred on the property and Noel decided to visit the area. One evening, he built a large bonfire in hopes of attracting the creature. Previous Sasquatch videos have indicated that the animal becomes interested by large fires and loud activity. During the fire, Noel used an infrared video camera to pan the wooded area surrounding the trees. For those unfamiliar, an infrared camera can be used to capture heat images from flesh and blood organisms. The object becomes visible with the implementation of color.</p> <p>What to Look For</p> <p>As Christopher Noel spanned the area, he noticed a large object in a woodpile near the fire. In a later description of the event, Noel said that it took him a couple takes to notice the arm because it didn’t move. In the video, the Sasquatch is filmed for several seconds and shows an enormous body size. Much of the data surrounding the event was obtained only after the tape was studied. It appears that a large Bigfoot snuck up a heavily wooded ravine and watched Noel and the other people from a concealed position. Originally, all that was noticed in the clip was the large arm. However, after research was conducted, the head, eyes and face of the creature were located. </p> <p>In the video, the creature has its left arm extended around a tree and its head is located below the arm, peering through a hole in the woodpile. The figures hand is clearly visible in the clip. The infrared image of the eyes is the second brightest on the screen. Once again, the two eyes are located down and to the left of the arm. To clearly see the creature’s eyeballs, pause the clip at 15 seconds. In the still, you can see that the forehead of the animal is less bright. At one point in the video, the creature’s hand can be witnessed grabbing a large board. The great thing about the footage is that the boards in the film are still present at the scene. This has allowed for an accurate study of the objects body measurements. </p> <p>The conclusions of the study are amazing, giving the animal a set of eyes that are four inches in diameter, equal to the size of a baseball. The Sasquatch has a 12 inch hand, 5 inch thumb and 5 more inches between the eye sockets. It is interesting to note that the Sasquatch is heavily hidden at night. It might indicate that the Bigfoot feels he can be seen in the dark. While observing the fire, the Sasquatch can be witnessed moving its hands, but stays very stealth. The fact that the video was captured with forward looking infrared video gives it notoriety not evident in other Bigfoot clips. It appears that a living creature was filmed. The object is enormous, even in comparison to other Sasquatch encounters. </p> <p></p> <p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OA_CleK-UA&amp;feature=related</p> <p>The Utah Sasquatch family video was posted to YouTube by a user named Johnny, under the title ‘Bigfoot family sighting in Utah on January 3, 2011′. The upload includes the description “I took my kids and their friends hiking and sledding high up in the Utah Mountains. A few weeks later as I was watching the video clips, I spotted three different cases with unexplained creatures that appeared to be a family of Sasquatch. In the first clip, a Bigfoot is seen walking away into the trees. The second clip shows a different Bigfoot watching us and then disappearing. The 3rd clip appears to be another Bigfoot struggling to get away. We returned to the hills to look for prints, but the snow had melted.” The video shows a man who is filming a group of kids sledding. In the clips, three separate creatures can be seen in the immediate background.</p> <p>What to Look For</p> <p>In order to grasp what is happening in the video, you must watch the portion of the clip when the analyst zooms in on the action. It should be mentioned that the footage was posted in three separate clips because the filmmaker turned the camera on and off. This has caused some people to label the video a hoax. The first clip shows a humanoid creature hiding behind a bush. The creature gets up and walks away. The rise and fall motion is bizarre and consistent with similar Sasquatch videos. However, it appears that the figures left arm doesn’t move. This has caused researchers to claim it is hemiplegic. Hemiplegia is total paralysis of the arm, leg, and trunk on one side of the body. Personally, I find it hard enough to believe the clip shows a family of Sasquatch and will not take the position that they are also hemiplegic twins. </p> <p>Following the departure of the first Bigfoot, a second creature can be seen leaving from a bush on the far right side of the screen. This action was not noticed by Johnny in his original description. The second clip starts with a large creature standing completely still. It has been suggested that the Sasquatch got caught out in the open by the camera, so it acted like a tree. The filmmaker then pans away from the area to film a child sledding and when the picture returns, the stationary creature is gone. The footage raises suspicion, as it could be easily hoaxed and has some appalling implications about the creatures understanding of how the camera works. However, the final clip makes up for it. </p> <p>The third clip shows a Sasquatch running from the scene. The arm and leg movements of the creature are not humanlike. In Johnny’s original description, he makes the implication that the figure may be injured. However, the movement is consistent with other Bigfoot videos. When a large, not juvenile, Sasquatch is threatened and scared, as might have been the case for this creature after being caught out in the open, they run on all fours. It appears to be moving very fast with its limbs swaying back and forth. When viewing the enhanced clip, the action raises immediate emotion. The video confirms on many aspects of the Bigfoot profile, including a coned head, consistent color, long arms, strategic moving, tree-hiding, and an interest in children and loud behavior.</p> <p></p>  <p>The greatest Bigfoot footage of all time is the Patterson-Gimlin film. It was captured by Roger Patterson and Robert Gimlin on October 20, 1967. On the day in question, the men were researching Sasquatch reports near Bluff Creek, in California. They were on horseback and came across an overturned tree. As the pair rounded the tree, they spotted a large figure beside the creek. At the sight of the Bigfoot, Patterson’s horse reared. Roger quickly untangled himself from the straps and spent about twenty seconds removing the camera from his saddlebag. By the time he began to film the creature, Patterson was 120 feet (37 m) away. </p> <p>What to Look For</p> <p>Roger Patterson began to run after the Bigfoot with his 16mm camera. He stopped at a distance of about 80 feet (24 m) and captured the most famous section of the film. The Sasquatch looks over its right shoulder at Roger, who then falls to his knees. In the clip, the creature turns at the men a total of two times. Shortly after the final glance, the Bigfoot walks behind a grove of trees, reappears for a second and then walks away. After much research and speculation, it has been suggested that the video shows a mature female Sasquatch 7’4′′ and 700lbs. The creature in the video matches the description offered by others who have witnessed a Bigfoot. </p> <p>The Patterson-Gimlin tape confirms the Bigfoot profile on almost every point. Some of the features include Ostman’s pads, which are light colored pads located on the bottom of the feet. The creature has long arms, a coned head, a hair ridge down the spine, a slow walking pace, and a prominent brow ridge. Like other videos, it shows instinctual tree hiding and cupped gray hands. The Bigfoot has a hooded nose, an inline step, and a white color on the hands and feet. The Patterson-Gimlin film is one of the most controversial pieces of video in existence. Many scientists have judged it a hoax. For this article I have included two videos of the action. One shows the original footage, which gives a good sense of how far away Roger Patterson was from the Sasquatch. Here is a stabilized and zoomed version of the clip.</p> <p></p> + <p>Greenbrier Bigfoot Photograph</p> <p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFtq6QQ2Olc</p> <p>In 2010, a video was posted on YouTube describing a strange photograph that was taken near Greenbrier Sporting Club, in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. The picture was captured on one of the club’s trail cameras that monitor wildlife in the area. The figure has a strong resemblance to the creature seen in the Patterson-Gimlin footage. Many have claimed the image was manufactured with Photoshop.<br/> Some notable Sasquatch videos that have not been included in this article are the Blinking Eye Bigfoot captured by Tim Fasano in 2010, the Peguis Sasquatch filmed near Winnipeg, the Mike Greene thermal footage taken in North Carolina, the Bigfoot jumps over a stream clip, the Sobe bomb Bigfoot captured in Oklahoma, the Beast of Gum Hill and the nine steps Sasquatch footage. Some of the clips were left out because they are not available online.</p> </body></html>
