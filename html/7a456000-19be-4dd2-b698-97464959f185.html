We have decided to slightly change our list payment system to make it better for more people.</p> <p>Now, instead of just getting $100 for your list, the four best lists of each month will win an extra bonus payment of $500! If your list is one of the four we will send an extra $500 to your paypal address at the start of the following month. You will still receive your $100 payment as soon as we approve your list for publication.</p> <p>For more details (including details on how to send your list in) check out our Write for Listverse page.</p>
