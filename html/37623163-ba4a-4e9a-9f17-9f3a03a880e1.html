This update also includes a request so please be sure to read all the items below. I am sure that most people will be happy with item 3.</p> <p></p> <p>I have previously mentioned that I am considering a site redesign. I have now decided to definitely go ahead with this. Rather than run a competition I would like to receive submissions from our readers and their friends. You need to send me an email (to jamie at frater dot com) with a link to your design portfolio. If I like what I see I will send you the specs for what needs doing and ask for a price quote. I am also asking people on design websites so while I would like to offer the job to a listverser, I will go with the designer that seems most to suit our needs.</p> <p></p> <p>I have gone through the site categories and organized them for the first time since the site was launched three years ago. Some categories have been combined and we have a new one. These are the categories as they stand today:</p> <p>1. Art &amp; Literature: this combines the two categories of art and literature into one larger category<br/> 2. Bizarre: this remains unchanged<br/> 3. Crime &amp; Mystery: this combines the two categories of crime and mystery<br/> 4. Entertainment: this remains the same but may eventually include parts or all of movies and music<br/> 5. Fact &amp; Fiction: this is a new category; it includes all lists on myths, misconceptions, facts, and factlets<br/> 6. Food &amp; Health: this combines the two categories of the same names<br/> 7. History: this remains the same<br/> 8. Leisure &amp; Travel: this category combines sport, travel, and some leisure related lists which were previously included in “miscellaneous”<br/> 9. Listverse Admin: this was previously known as “Administration” and contains admin notes like this one<br/> 10. Listverse Extras: this includes archived “Your View” and “Videocast” lists<br/> 11. Miscellaneous: as before but I am slowly going through the contents to find more suitable categories<br/> 12. Movies: as before<br/> 13. Music: as before<br/> 14. People &amp; Politics: this combines the two categories of the same name<br/> 15. Religion: unchanged<br/> 16. Science &amp; Nature: this combines the two categories of the same name</p> <p>What I would like to do is work out a way to combine the appropriate lists in entertainment, music, and movies. I don’t want to turn it into one giant 300 list long category so suggestions for how I might best sort it out would be appreciated.</p> <p></p> <p>Due to the response from the recent trial of cursor ads, they have been dropped from the site completely. They will not return. While they would have been a good income boost for us, it is more important that people enjoy their time on the site – otherwise what is the point?</p> <p></p> <p>We are about to launch a new commenting system. As we migrate to it there may be a period of commenting downtime. This is not able to be helped but we are sure the new features to come will make it worthwhile.</p>
