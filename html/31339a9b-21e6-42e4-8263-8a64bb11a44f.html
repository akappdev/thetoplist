It contains a message of joy and love replacing sin and sorrow. It may also be interpreted to be about life after the second coming of Christ. The hymn is significant for its widespread use throughout Christian denominations and for the musical stature of the people who created it.</p> <p>This is a great Christmas carol everyone can sing along to, and the duet by Billy Porter and Vanessa Williams is amazing.</p> 8.
