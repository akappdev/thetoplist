There are many forms of creationism – the belief that God sparked the big bang leading to the eventual formation of the universe as we know it, to the belief that God literally created everything in 7 days. Opposing this view is that of Science which excludes a prime mover. Remember, be fair in the debate and no ad hominem attacks!</p> <p>Should Creationism Be Taught In Schools?<br/> </p> <p>My answer: I think that there is a sufficiently high percentage of people who believe in some form of special creation that the belief system could be explained to students. I don’t advocate it being taught as “truth” against the scientific theories of creation, but there is no reason that only one idea must be taught. So I think it certainly could be taught in social studies class, or religious education class (in religious schools), but definitely <em>not</em> in Science class.
