Although I can’t put my finger on what this original list was, I began reading more and more, until I was hooked. Although there is plenty of variety in the types of lists, the category that got myself (and many others) was the bizarre. Creepy, eerie, eccentric, and just flat-out weird lists were the ones that kept me up at night, reading one after the other. It was these lists that inspired me to contribute, and thankfully, I was allowed to have a good many of my lists published on the site. Because Listverse’s best lists are the ones pertaining to the bizarre, music, videos, or holidays, I am pulling out all the stops to bring you this compilation of thirteen music videos sure to raise the spook factor. Some are fun, some are creative, some are creepy, and all of them are bizarre in their own way. So curl up, turn off the lights, and crank the volume. Halloween is fast approaching, so get watching! Please make sure to include any that I missed in the comments!</p> <p></p> 13 <p>Thriller</p> <p>Michael Jackson- Thriller</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOnqjkJTMaA&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en_US]</p> <p>This classic of Halloween parties everywhere has left a legacy that has yet to be overthrown. No song or music video to date has been more closely associated with the spookiest of holidays. This video is first on the list, not because it is the least of the videos presented, but because it is a terribly obvious choice, and we all want the list to be unpredictable, don’t we? Having said that, it would be a crime to leave this video off the list. Enjoy this light hearted classic, the rest gets darker.</p> <p></p> 12 <p>I Miss You</p> <p>blink-182- Eponymous album</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1tAYmMjLdY&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en_US]</p> <p>This sappy song would probably be considered a light hearted teenage romance soundtrack, were it not for the dark Gothic video that accompanies it. The video recalls visualizations of Edgar Allen Poe’s dreary material.</p> <p></p> 11 <p>Papercut</p> <p>Linkin Park- Hybrid Theory</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjVkXlxsO8Q&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en_US]</p> <p>This video comes from Linkin Park’s first (and best) album, Hybrid Theory. Back before they were serenading the mainstream with every single, Linkin Park took a few trips towards some darker material. This song about paranoia features the band playing in a haunted house filled with strange creatures.</p>  10 <p>Clown</p> <p>Korn- Eponymous album</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs_E9TP6cvE&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en_US]</p> <p>Coulrophobes beware! The video stays true to the name. Although the song itself doesn’t reference clowns in a literal sense (the clown of the song is a derogatory nickname for a Korn hater who once tried to punch the lead singer). It uses a true story about the band to make a statement against bullying.</p> <p></p> 9 <p>Sun Doesn’t Rise</p> <p>Mushroomhead- XIII</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOaqcfTZgno&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en_US]</p> <p>The first of a few masked bands on the list is a personal favorite, Mushroomhead. This bizarre stop-motion video cuts between the band playing in their masks, a young girl, and a scarecrow being harassed by a flock of very pissed of crows (he obviously isn’t a very good scarecrow). The video for Mushroomhead’s most popular song saw heavy rotation on MTV 2 and Headbanger’s Ball back when it was released. A few other Mushroomhead videos worth checking out for their Halloween-appropriate material: Burn and 12 Hundred.</p>  8 <p>Dragula</p> <p>Rob Zombie- Hellbilly Deluxe</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqQuihD0hoI&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en_US]</p> <p>An entire list could be filled by Rob Zombie videos, and it was hard to limit it to one. But because it is one of his first and most popular songs, and because the video is a weird tribute to old cheesy horror films, this video made the list! For more Halloween-appropriate videos by Rob Zombie... Just watch pretty much any of his videos!</p> <p></p> 7 <p>Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)</p> <p>Marilyn Manson- Smells Like Children</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6VojYGrnpg&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en_US]</p> <p>As with Mr. Zombie, an entire list could be composed just from Marilyn Manson videos. But since Beautiful People (the most popular song) was included on Top Ten Bizarre Music Videos, I included this cover of Eurythmics’ Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This). The controversial took an enormously popular 80’s synth hit and turned it into a slow, creepy metal song song, worthy of it’s odd video.</p> <p></p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAuo8IOFNuE&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en_US]</p> <p>Eminem’s usually goofy alter ego Slim Shady takes the reigns for this rap that accurately sums up the mythology and psychosis of serial killers. A cocktail of drugs fuels the killing sprees highlighted in the song, and the light hearted (sometimes funny) lyrics depict how carefree most serial killers are about their actions. Not one of Em’s better raps, but certainly one of his most creative!</p>  5 <p>Asylum</p> <p>Disturbed- Asylum</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1K9jBL2syJ8&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en_US]</p> <p>Disturbed’s latest album brings us one of their most bizarre videos. Have you ever thought you were crazy? Ok, have you ever wanted to escape all the horrific thoughts in your own head? Well, you can’t. The dreary metaphor the video highlights is an excellent one, although it is occasionally made laughable by cheesy special effects. Sounds like most horror movies!</p> <p></p> 4 <p>Death Blooms</p> <p>Mudvayne- L.D. 50</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nVvojfQVBY&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en_US]</p> <p>What could have been a touching story of a neglected, dying old woman is spun into a bizarre, creepy dreamscape in this Mudvayne outing. Although the band no longer wears their elaborate makeup, this song shows them back from the days when they would apply their signature facepaint and prosthetics. And it makes for one strange trip.</p> <p></p> 3 <p>Spit It Out</p> <p>Slipknot- Eponymous album</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8e5zkX2JRc&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en_US]</p> <p>This hyper active piece of thrash is so high up on the list because it A) s bizarre, B) is genuinely creepy, and C) is a tribute to Kubrick’s The Shining. The nine from Des Moine released this violent song as vengeance to a radio station that constantly berated them, and you can see the inspiration did the song well. Look for a spoof of the infamous “heeeeeeere’s Johnny!” moment during the bridge of the song.</p> <p></p> 2 <p>Come To Daddy</p> <p>Aphex Twin- Come To Daddy EP</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Az_7U0-cK0&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en_US]</p> <p>I’m sure Aphex Twin was expected by some to make an appearance. I assume you are not disappointed. Although many AT videos could have been chosen, this one makes the list for the same reason as most others: It is popular, it is creepy. Scary kids? Check. Disturbingly distorted faces? Check. Disturbingly distorted faces ON scary kids? Hot damn.</p> <p></p> 1 <p>Quote/Unquote</p> <p>Mr. Bungle- Mr. Bungle</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtDEmtwuTlI&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en_US]</p> <p>Ok, coulrophobes, forget what I said about Korn’s video a few items back. Avoid THIS video. Creepy carnival-style rock music, eerie clown and gimp masks, religiously offensive images and a ban from MTV all helped shoot this video to the top of the list. But what cemented it here was the fact, while all the other videos on the list could be described as creepy, this video MUST be described as creepy. Anything else would take away from a truly bizarre experience, so you’ll just have to watch....</p> </body></html>
