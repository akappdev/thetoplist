Some of the most remarkable and groundbreaking poetry has come from US poets living in or away from home. Below is a sampling of the work of 10 of the greatest American poems from the 20th century.</p> <p><strong>1. the Wasteland</strong> – T S Eliot</p> <p>Eliot was born an American, moved to the United Kingdom in 1914 (at the age of 25), and became a British subject in 1927 at the age of 39.</p> <p> April is the cruelest month, breeding <br/> Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing<br/> Memory and desire, stirring<br/> Dull roots with spring rain.<br/> Winter kept us warm, covering<br/> Earth in forgetful snow, feeding<br/> A little life with dried tubers.<br/> Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee<br/> With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,<br/> And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,<br/> And drank coffee, and talked for an hour. </p> <p>Read the rest here</p> <p><strong>2. Howl</strong> – Allen Ginsberg</p> <p>Ginsberg is best known for Howl (1956), a long poem about the self-destruction of his friends of the Beat Generation and what he saw as the destructive forces of materialism and conformity in United States at the time.</p> <p> I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by <br/> madness, starving hysterical naked, <br/> dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn <br/> looking for an angry fix, <br/> angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly <br/> connection to the starry dynamo in the machin- <br/> ery of night, <br/> who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat <br/> up smoking in the supernatural darkness of <br/> cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities <br/> contemplating jazz, <br/> who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and <br/> saw Mohammedan angels staggering on tene- <br/> ment roofs illuminated, <br/> who passed through universities with radiant cool eyes <br/> hallucinating Arkansas and Blake-light tragedy <br/> among the scholars of war, <br/> who were expelled from the academies for crazy &amp; <br/> publishing obscene odes on the windows of the <br/> skull... </p> <p>Read the rest here</p> <p><strong>3. Daddy</strong> – Sylvia Plath</p> <p>Along with Anne Sexton, Plath is credited with advancing the genre of confessional poetry that Robert Lowell and W.D. Snodgrass initiated.</p> <p> You do not do, you do not do</p><p> Any more, black shoe</p><p> In which I have lived like a foot</p><p> For thirty years, poor and white,</p><p> Barely daring to breathe or Achoo. </p><p>Daddy, I have had to kill you.<br/> You died before I had time–<br/> Marble-heavy, a bag full of God,<br/> Ghastly statue with one gray toe<br/> Big as a Frisco seal</p> <p>And a head in the freakish Atlantic<br/> Where it pours bean green over blue<br/> In the waters off beautiful Nauset.<br/> I used to pray to recover you.<br/> Ach, du. </p> <p>Read the rest here</p> <p><strong>4. The Snow Man</strong> – Wallace Stevens</p> <p>Stevens’s first book of poetry, Harmonium, was published in 1923.

This is just to say</strong> – Carolos Williams</p> <p>Dr. William Carlos Williams (sometimes known as WCW) (September 17, 1883 – March 4, 1963), was an American poet closely associated with modernism and Imagism. Williams has a theatre named after him in his hometown Rutherford, called “The Williams Center”</p> <p> I have eaten</p><p> the plums</p><p> that were in</p><p> the icebox </p><p>and which<br/> you were probably<br/> saving<br/> for breakfast.</p> <p>Forgive me<br/> they were delicious<br/> so sweet<br/> and so cold. </p> <p><strong>6. Somewhere I have never traveled, gladly beyond</strong> – E E Cummings</p> <p>Edward Estlin Cummings (October 14, 1894 – September 3, 1962), popularly known as E. E. Cummings, was an American poet, painter, essayist, and playwright. His body of work encompasses more than 900 poems, several plays and essays, numerous drawings, sketches, and paintings, as well as two novels.</p> <p> somewhere i have never travelled,gladly beyond</p><p> any experience,your eyes have their silence:</p><p> in your most frail gesture are things which enclose me,</p><p> or which i cannot touch because they are too near </p><p>your slightest look will easily unclose me<br/> though i have closed myself as fingers,<br/> you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens<br/> (touching skilfully,mysteriously)her first rose </p> <p>Read the rest here</p> <p><strong>7. The People, Yes</strong> – Carl Sandburg</p> <p>Carl August Sandburg (January 6, 1878 – July 22, 1967) was an American poet, historian, novelist, balladeer, and folklorist. He was born in Galesburg, Illinois of Swedish parents and died at his home, named Connemara, in Flat Rock, North Carolina.</p> <p> The people yes<br/> The people will live on.<br/> The learning and blundering people will live on.<br/> They will be tricked and sold and again sold<br/> And go back to the nourishing earth for rootholds,<br/> The people so peculiar in renewal and comeback,<br/> You can’t laugh off their capacity to take it.<br/> The mammoth rests between his cyclonic dramas. </p> <p>Read more here</p> <p><strong>8. Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening</strong> – Robert Frost</p> <p>Frost’s work frequently used themes from rural life in New England, using the setting to examine complex social and philosophical themes. A popular and often-quoted poet, Frost was honored frequently during his lifetime, receiving four Pulitzer Prizes.</p> <p> Whose woods these are I think I know.<br/> His house is in the village though;<br/> He will not see me stopping here<br/> To watch his woods fill up with snow.<br/> My little horse must think it queer<br/> To stop without a farmhouse near<br/> Between the woods and frozen lake<br/> The darkest evening of the year.<br/> He gives his harness bells a shake<br/> To ask if there is some mistake.<br/> The only other sound’s the sweep<br/> Of easy wind and downy flake.<br/> The woods are lovely, dark and deep.<br/> But I have promises to keep,<br/> And miles to go before I sleep,<br/> And miles to go before I sleep. </p> <p><strong>9. Shine, Perishing Republic</strong> – Robinson Jeffers</p> <p>John Robinson Jeffers (January 10, 1887–January 20, 1962) was an American poet, known for his work about the central California coast. Most of Jeffers’ poetry was written in classic narrative and epic form, but today he is also known for his short verse, and considered an icon of the environmental movement.</p> <p>While this America settles in the mould of its vulgarity, heavily thickening<br/> to empire<br/> And protest, only a bubble in the molten mass, pops and sighs out, and the<br/> mass hardens,<br/> I sadly smiling remember that the flower fades to make fruit, the fruit rots<br/> to make earth.<br/> Out of the mother; and through the spring exultances, ripeness and decadence;<br/> and home to the mother.<br/> You making haste haste on decay: not blameworthy; life is good, be it stubbornly<br/> long or suddenly<br/> A mortal splendor: meteors are not needed less than mountains:<br/> shine, perishing republic.<br/> But for my children, I would have them keep their distance from the thickening<br/> center; corruption<br/> Never has been compulsory, when the cities lie at the monster’s feet there<br/> are left the mountains.<br/> And boys, be in nothing so moderate as in love of man, a clever servant,<br/> insufferable master.<br/> There is the trap that catches noblest spirits, that caught – they say –<br/> God, when he walked on earth.</p> <p><strong>10. For the Union Dead</strong> – Robert Lowell</p> <p>Robert Lowell (March 1, 1917–September 12, 1977), born Robert Traill Spence Lowell, IV, was an American poet whose works, confessional in nature, engaged with the questions of history and probed the dark recesses of the self. He is generally considered to be among the greatest American poets of the twentieth century.</p> <p> The old South Boston Aquarium stands</p><p> in a Sahara of snow now. Its broken windows are boarded.</p><p> The bronze weathervane cod has lost half its scales.</p><p> The airy tanks are dry. </p><p>Once my nose crawled like a snail on the glass;<br/> my hand tingled<br/> to burst the bubbles<br/> drifting from the noses of the cowed, compliant fish. </p> <p>Read the rest here</p> <p>I must give a tip of the hat to Ezra Pound who is brilliant, but the lawyers of his estate work very hard to ensure that his poetry is not available on the internet.</p> <p>Technorati Tags: literature, poetry</p>
