Ever been in bed, and decide to flick on the television to watch some late night comedy, and then the ads come on? Many are tolerable but many are appalling. This is a list of 10 of the most ridiculous infomercials and their products that make you contemplate whether you’re actually awake, or if it’s some crazy dream. Please feel free to add your own to the comments for all to enjoy.</p>  <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeYdAoZyNMI&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>I find it absolutely ridiculous this women can’t cook a hard boiled egg, but can some how manage to make eggs Benedict with hollandaise sauce, and deviled eggs. It’s egg-cellent!</p> <p></p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gw1g2yKxb0I&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>Or should I say the titty Bear which is exactly what the actors all sound like they are saying.</p>  <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9_amg-Aos4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>This keeps me wondering: Why didn’t I think of this?</p> <p></p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtpKjgwi4Sc&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>A family reunion with your hosts Mick and Mimi, and their cynical, hungover family members. The product itself isn’t so bad, I’ve got one in my own home, makes delicious smoothies... It is more the over exaggerated acting that makes you too uncomfortable to compute. Though drunken old cigarette hag is a good plus. I can’t explain why, but I found it very difficult to stop watching. It even includes the obligatory “man with an English accent” to lend credibility to the product.</p> <p></p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXcYVh-W14E&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>Just watch...</p>  5 <p>The Flip Fold Shirt Folder/Flipper</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjAWsY9padQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>Are we really so incompetent that we can’t fold a shirt?</p> <p></p> 4 <p>Topsy Turvy Tomato Planter</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g62QJPBNctI&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>I wonder how they lived without THIS before! Imagine trying to explain this to your guests at the barbeque...</p> <p></p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoHMd1yOBfM&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>This clip contains some seriously revolting images.</p> <p></p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1tufV0u5Ec&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>This one is going to give me nightmares. It is not actually the original informercial from QVC but rather a personal testament to the product. You might want to check out the youtube comments after watching this – some of them are priceless.</p> <p></p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h05ZQ7WHw8Y&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>What list on infomercials could I have without the Snuggie? Where would I even BE without the Snuggie? Here is a great parody of the original commercial: WARNING: it contains offensive language in a few places. And here is the original infomercial.</p>
