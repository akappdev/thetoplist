This is a selection of the absolute <strong>worst</strong> scenes in movies. Prepare to cringe!</p> 10 <p>Nightmare on Elm Street 2</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLsSQWpNW7c]</p> <p>If horror movies terrify you, don’t worry about this scene – it is about as scary as an episode of Sesame Street. How they managed to get funding to make more movies after this mess I do not know. In this scene, the family parakeet kills its mate and then attacks the family.</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1G-RvZC1-s]</p> <p>Here we see Linda Blair of Exorcist fame wearing extremely large shoulder pads, followed by a scene of some guy doing a lot of yelling for no apparent reason. Fortunately, when the yelling guy harasses Linda, she remains completely calm... in fact, she remains about as calm as the piece of wood that taught her how to act.</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eC2jV8sCv1c&amp;hl=en]</p> <p>In this clip we have the Worst. Fight. Scene. Ever. You just have to watch it to believe it – there is really nothing I can say about it.</p> 7 <p>The Best of Yucca Flats</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qB6IIXCPoAQ]</p> <p>In this scene we see the beast (a Russian scientist transformed in to a monster by radiation) strangling Jim. The problem is – it kinda looks like he is trying to get it on with him! Eventually Jim’s friend shoots the monster – though you wouldn’t know it except for the sound effects. Best line: “Jim... are you alright?”</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRLSOmEVgIg&amp;hl=en]</p> <p>Superman IV has to be the worst of the Superman franchise of movies. In this one we see bad acting from otherwise good actors, as well as special effects that can only be called special in the sense of a “special” school. When the girl (or should I say doll) flies out the window it is hysterical.</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TNa15pS6gw]</p> <p>In this clip we see the big bad shark eating people – lots of people, people on rafts, people on jetskis, people diving off boats. Basically, that is it. Om nom nom nom.</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9rfIdQxjc]</p> <p>In this scene we see what I would consider to be the worst car chase in movies. The production team obviously couldn’t afford bullets or damage to the cars so the cops just wave the bad guy over. The best part, of course, is the gravity defying driving – you need to see it to believe it. Best line? “Don’t tell me you stole this car!” “I won’t then.”</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ00laVt62c&amp;hl=en]</p> <p>In this scene, the geeky friend of the teen witch is magically transformed in to a “hip chick” so she can impress the school badass. This scene features what I would consider to be the worst rap in history (yes – even worse than Madonna’s rap in American Life). Check out the hip moves and awesome lyrics. Best line? “Look how funky he is!”</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wxr77yDXMYU]</p> <p>Warning: This clip contains tacky scenes of b-grade violence. Watching this clip it is hard to believe that Nicholas Cage is an Oscar winning actor! This is absolutely the pits. After a ridiculously lame fight involving the tearing off of a fake beard, Cage simply loses control and basically screams a lot for no reason. Nice. Best line? “Come on bitch! Alright! Alright! Okay baby girl! Who sent ya?! Who sent ya?!”</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT6ZIgH5dI8]</p> <p>Here we have a combination of bad acting, bad script writing, insanity, and perhaps the most evil mother in film history. Mama’s behavior in this scene later caused the poor little girl (Sybil) to get multiple personalities. Best line? “Now don’t worry, I’m not going to hit you this time. This time I’m only gonna kick ya!”</p>
