So, here is our first (and hopefully not last) list of the best (and funniest) cameos in movie history. If you can think of other great cameos, be sure to tell us in the comments (include a youtube link if you can).</p> 10 <p>Scream 3</p> <p>Jay and Silent Bob</p> <p>What really makes this cameo funny is not necessarily the lewd dialogue, it’s the story behind how the slacker duo got involved in Scream 3. They were both given 300 dollars per diem while on set, and a free shirt. Jason Mewes (Jay) was a bit more excited about it than Kevin Smith (Silent Bob), saying: “We should do this all the time. We can pop up in every horror movie, and get three hundred bucks a day and a shirt!” Smith told him he could make a lot more money in a starring role, and Mewes respectfully pondered the idea.</p> 9 <p>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</p> <p>Hunter S. Thompson</p> <p>Dr. Gonzo appears very briefly in Terry Gilliam’s classic film that is based off Thompson’s book. During the flashback/Jefferson Airplane scene. Depp walks by him and narrates: “There I was... Mother of God, there I am. Holy fuck.” Fear and Loathing is known for many great cameos, including Gary Busey, Tobey Maguire, and director Gilliam.</p> <p>There isn’t much I can say besides Thank You Chuck Norris.</p> 7 <p>Hot Shots! Part Deux</p> <p>Martin Sheen</p> <p>In this war film parody, Martin Sheen steals his son Charlie’s thunder by interrupting his narration with a little voice-over of his own. It concludes with one of the funniest lines in spoof history.</p> 6 <p>Grindhouse</p> <p>Nicolas Cage</p> <p>Nick Cage appears as Fu Manchu in the fake trailer “Werewolf Women of the S.S.” directed by Rob Zombie for the movie Grindhouse. I don’t think I am alone when I say that the fake trailers were probably the best part of Grindhouse, and include such gems as Machete, Thanksgiving, and Don’t! Cage’s cameo is short and sweet, and it gets me every time.</p> 5 <p>Cabin Boy</p> <p>David Letterman</p> <p>This film is both greatly loved and severely detested. Those who support it point out its campy qualities, and claim that it’s so bad it’s good (like the Wicker Man remake, right? Or does it just suck?) Letterman’s cameo was his first role in a feature film and it is a lot like the rest of the movie, so bad it’s good. See for yourself.</p> 4 <p>The Muppet Movie</p> <p>Steve Martin</p> <p>The Muppet Movie is known for its parade of cameos, but Martin’s role as the ‘insolent waiter’ combines his bizarre sense of humor with the universal appeal of the muppets. What ensues is a fantastic fusion of dry humor and soaking wet slapstick.</p> 3 <p>Happy Gilmore</p> <p>Bob Barker</p> <p>The best part about this cameo is how Bob is in great shape. You really believe that he could kick some ass if taunted. Apparently Barker accepted the role after learning that he would win the fight. I’m sure he felt even more vindication after winning the MTV Movie Award for Best Fight. The best part of the clip begins around 00:58.</p> 2 <p>The Princess Bride</p> <p>Billy Crystal and Carol Kane</p> <p>This cameo is as perfect as the movie itself. I wouldn’t say that Crystal and Kane make the movie, but they do serve as the cherry-on-top of a hilarious sundae. The decrepit yet spry married couple were so funny that Rob Reiner had to leave the set because he was laughing so hard.</p> <p>Extras, a sitcom created by Ricky Gervais and his writing partner Stephen Merchant, is one of the funniest TV shows of all time. It was hard to believe that they could live up to the comedic brilliance that was The Office, but they did it with Extras, which aired on HBO. Every episode has at least one celebrity appearance, all of them playing themselves. The words that Gervais puts in their mouths are usually so insensitive and vain that it is unfathomable how they all agreed to it. To name a few: David Bowie, Ian McKellen, Kate Winslet, Ben Stiller, Chris Martin, Daniel Radcliffe, Robert De Niro.</p> <p>This clip shows David Bowie’s hilarious cameo. My personal favorite has to be Ian McKellen explaining his stage play to Gervais. The timing and delivery is so spot-on it brought me to tears the first time I saw it. If you have not seen this show please, please, PLEASE try and watch it. It does not disappoint.</p> <p>Contributor: ThatGuy</p> </body></html>
