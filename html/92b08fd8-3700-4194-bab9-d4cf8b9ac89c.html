Here they are in descending order:</p> <p>Howard Shore created one of the funkiest soundtracks of his career at the behest of Tim Burton for this luscious comedy, turning the Waltz from Carmen into a symphonic requiem without equal.</p> <p>Darren Daronofsky had his breathtaking film complimented by the intensely beautiful work of Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet, that merges with the film’s scenery in an Olympian amalgam of grace and meticulous style. A modern classic. Note: the video pictures are not from the film.</p> <p>One of the most inspirational and historically accountable scores in cinema, Maurice Jarre composed an epic soundtrack that oozes with themes of rebellion, paranoia and revolution. It remains one the most honorable Oscar-winning scores in history.</p> <p>Philip Glass’s hypnotizing score served as a brooding alternative to the original film’s lack of a soundtrack, and the Kronos Quartet make the most of their efforts. With every descending third note we spiral along in to the darkness of the film, helping it to regain its eerie essence.</p> <p>“Moon River” won a well-deserved Oscar after becoming the highlight of this film’s majestic score, contributing to the greatest songs recorded for the screen. It’s beauty and grace continues to resound after forty years, and the swelling choral motif adds to an already moving score.</p> <p>Clint Mansell at his peak with an angelic leitmotif that grows grimmer as the film progresses; a triumph. Once you have seen this film you will never forget the theme and the images it evokes.</p> 4 <p>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</p> <p>A theme that everyone from the 80s will remember well. By the masterful John Williams – little else needs to be said really.</p> <p>Again by the great John Williams – there is not a person alive who has access to cinema who won’t recognize this theme. The crowd reaction in the live recording above says it all. The end-all be-all in science fiction scores, legendary in its own time as well as ours.</p> <p>Leonard Cohen’s songs are rightly regarded as among the most prestigious in history, and the ones contributed to this film are no less important or seminal. If you haven’t heard the songs in this film yet, make the effort. You will not be disappointed by their depth, clarity and beauty.</p> <p>F.W. Murnau’s film contains one of the greatest scores in silent film history, and remains a legend for the dance of Mephisto alone, a morbid chorus resounding hauntingly through its vital, imaginative scenery. It’s importance is not to be forgotten. Modern film would not contain the same amount of innovation without this or any of Murnau’s contributions.</p> Bonus <p>Saturday Night Fever</p> <p>You didn’t think I would forget, did you?</p> <p>Contributor: F.
