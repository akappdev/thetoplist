Pink Flamingos is a 1972 American transgressive comedy directed by John Waters. When the film was initially released in 1972, it caused a huge degree of controversy and eventually became one of the most notorious cult films ever made. It is one of John Waters’ most famous or downright notorious films due to some shocking scenes and the wide range of perverse, taboo acts performed in the film, such as consumption of animal feces. IMDB has this to say on the plot: Sleaze queen Divine lives in a caravan with her mad hippie son Crackers and her 250-pound mother Mama Edie, trying to rest quietly on their laurels as ‘the filthiest people alive’. But competition is brewing in the form of Connie and Raymond Marble, who sell heroin to schoolchildren and kidnap and impregnate female hitchhikers, selling the babies to lesbian couples. Finally, they challenge Divine directly, and battle commences...</p> 7 <p>Sweet Movie</p> <p>1974, Dusan Makavejev</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N6we7OUOOk&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>It may be called Sweet Movie, but it is anything but! This is the intercut story of two women: a nearly-mute beauty queen who descends into withdrawal and madness, and another who captains a ship laden with candy and sugar, luring men and boys aboard for sex, death, and revolutionary talk. The beauty queen passes from a wealthy husband whose honeymoon delight is to urinate on her, to a muscular keeper who punches her, stows her in a suitcase, and ships her to Paris, to a lip-synching rock idol with whom she has a love spasm, to an Austrian commune complete with a banquet of vomit, urine, feces, chopped dildos, and wet nurses.</p> 6 <p>Cutting Moments</p> <p>1999, Douglas Buck</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTBEPS6n_8U&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>Cutting Moments is the title of a highly acclaimed, highly controversial short feature from 1999 directed by Douglas Buck. Not only is it gory, it was also heart-wrenching and painful to watch. Briefly, the synopsis is: in the center of a monotonous suburban existence, Sarah lives silently and in subservience to her icy husband Patrick. They have been together far too long, and Patrick’s affections for his wife have all but vanished. Instead, his sexual urges are tempting him to lust after their own son. Realizing how far gone her husband is, Sarah undertakes drastic, shockingly sickening measures to salvage some sense of her life and purge her years of festering resentment</p> 5 <p>Men Behind the Sun</p> <p>1988, Mou Tun Fei</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_t7ZVFUA1U&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>The film is a graphic depiction of the war atrocities committed by the Japanese at Unit 731, the secret biological weapons experimentation unit of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. The film details the various cruel medical experiments Unit 731 inflicted upon the Chinese and Soviet prisoners at the tail-end of the war. Because of its graphic content, the film has suffered mass controversy with censors all over the world. It was originally banned in Australia and caused public outcry in Japan to such an extent that director T.F. Mou even received threats on his life. The film is extremely controversial for its use of what Mou claims to be actual autopsy footage of a young boy and also for a scene in which two cats are thrown into a room to be eaten alive by hundreds of frenzied rats (the rats are later set ablaze).</p> 4 <p>Flower of Flesh and Blood</p> <p>1985, Hideshi Hino</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L84hGKGcbos&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>Flower of Flesh and Blood is said to be based on a snuff film sent to the director Hideshi Hino by a crazed fan. In it, a man dressed as a samurai drugs a woman and proceeds to cut her apart, and finally adds her body parts to an extensive collection. The snuff film rumour has been shown to be a contemporary legend; the film was in fact based on a manga (by Hideshi Hino himself, no less) about a florist who kills women and uses their dismembered parts as the seed of his beautiful flower arrangements. After viewing a portion of this film, actor Charlie Sheen was convinced the murder depicted was genuine and contacted the MPAA, who then contacted the FBI. FBI agent Dan Codling informed them that the FBI and the Japanese authorities were already investigating the film makers, who were forced to prove that the special effects were indeed fake. This is the second film is what is known as the Guinea Pig films.</p> 3 <p>Slaughtered Vomit Dolls</p> <p>2006, Lucifer Valentine</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKJ__hFl39k&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;fs=1]</p> <p>The gruesome tapestry of psychological manifestations of a nineteen year old bulimic runaway stripper – turned prostitute named Angela Aberdeen; as she descends into a hellish pit of Satanic nightmares and hallucinations. True to its name, this film contains no shortage of actual vomiting mixed in with a healthy dose of slaughter. To its credit, the title does not lie. The film contains scenes of extreme violence like eyeballs being gouged out mixed in with scenes of self inflicted vomiting. All of which is intercut with a home movie of a little girl, presumably one of the girls in the film (or representing all of the girls in the film for that matter) during a once happier time in her life and their ultimate loss of innocence.

The film depicts a dysfunctional love triangle of sorts between the volatile lead from the original August Underground (portrayed by Toetag founder Fred Vogel), his maniacal girlfriend and partner-in-crime Crusty (Christie Whiles), and Crusty’s animalistic brother, appropriately dubbed Maggot (Michael Schneider). As Maggot’s mental facilities decline and competition with Vogel’s character for the affections of Crusty mounts, tensions simmer before coming to full boil at Mordum’s climax: Maggot manages to wrestle Vogel’s knife out of his hands and then proceeds to...
