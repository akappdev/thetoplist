Basically we propose a question, answer it ourselves, and then ask you to tell us what you think.</p> <p>I have decided this week that we will bring this feature back to help us all get to know each other better, and, perhaps most importantly, to share our knowledge with others here. </p> <p>So, this week’s Your View question is: “What Is The Worst Movie That Everyone Loves?”</p> <p>My answer is: “Crash” from 2004, directed by Paul Haggis and starring Sandra Bullock, Ryan Phillippe, and Matt Dillon. It scores a whopping 7.8 on IMDB and won the Oscar for the best picture at the 78th Academy Awards.</p> <p>I have watched this film numerous times hoping I might have been wrong about it the last time. While I totally get the premise of showing how harmful racism can be, each scene of racism depicted comes across as completely farcical. It is like someone who has never seen actual racism said “this is what racism must look like!” and then put it in the script.</p> <p>Some of the acting was good (as you would expect with the likes of Ryan Phillippe who can be excellent at times) but the story line and scripting was so clearly trying to send a message that the actual message got lost.</p> <p>This film is to racism, what Disney’s magic castle is to Hohenzollern Castle.</p>
