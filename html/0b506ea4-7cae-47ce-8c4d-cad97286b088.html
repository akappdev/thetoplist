Women—and sometimes their male companions—are brutally and often publicly slaughtered. Most of these incidents take place in countries where the perpetrators can act with impunity. The reasons given to justify these crimes are bizarre and nonsensical.</p> <h2>10 She Wanted To Become An Attorney</h2>  <p>Shafilea Ahmed was a 17-year-old girl living in Britain who dreamed of becoming an attorney one day. On the day of her murder, she enraged her parents by wearing a short-sleeved, V-neck top without a sweater.</p> <p>Originally from Pakistan, her parents were furious with their daughter for wanting to live a Westernized lifestyle and for aspiring to become an attorney. Other reports claim that her parents had arranged her marriage with a cousin in rural Pakistan, and Shafilea was horrified by the idea. When she found out about the arrangement, she consumed bleach in protest and was taken to a hospital for treatment.</p> <p>After abusing Shafilea for months, her parents suffocated her with a plastic bag in the presence of their other four children. Then Shafilea’s father dumped her body in the River Kent in Cumbria.</p> <p>She was reported missing by her teacher a week later. To explain her September 2003 disappearance, her father claimed that she had run away from home in the middle of the night. Six months later, her decomposed remains were found by workmen. Shafilea was identified by her dental records and jewelry.</p> <p>Her mother initially denied her involvement in the crime. She claimed that she had tried to intervene to protect the girl, but her husband had physically overpowered her. However, the testimony of their daughter, Alesha, incriminated both parents in Shafilea’s murder.</p> <p>During the trial, Alesha described how her parents had pushed Shafilea onto the sofa, and her mother had said, “Just finish it there.” In 2012, the parents, Iftikhar and Farzana Ahmed, were sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for at least 25 years.</p> <h2>9 She Spent Long

<p>“I am proud of what I did,” said 20-year-old Muhammad Ismail after shooting his wife, mother-in-law, and sister-in-law in February 2012 in a village in central Pakistan. According to Ismail, his wife of eight months had brought him dishonor by spending long hours away from home and repeatedly flirting with other men. He called her a prostitute and accused her of “never taking care of him.”</p> <p>These suspicions and grievances were the basis of the triple murder. In an interview with CNN from behind bars, Ismail recalled wounding his wife with a bullet. He left her in a pool of blood to go into the next room and shoot his mother-in-law and sister-in-law. Then he returned to finish off his wife with the remaining bullets.</p> <p>When he was sure they were all dead, he locked up the house and went to the police. Despite giving them a confession, Ismail might have gotten off scot-free if his victims’ family had accepted compensation for the killings, a common occurrence in such situations.</p> <p>In countries like Pakistan, where women are perceived as dispensable chattel, their lives are worth little. In these societies, being anything less than a devoted and loving wife can get a woman killed and endanger the lives of her female relatives.</p> <h2>8 She Failed In School</h2>  <p>In Montreal, Mohammed Shafia, his second wife, and their son were convicted of the first-degree murders of Mohammed’s three teenage daughters and his first wife in his polygamous marriage. Afghan immigrant Shafia and wife Tooba Mohammad Yahya had confessed to plotting the murders, with Mohammed referring to his daughters as “whores.”</p> <p>Apparently, they were upset with the eldest daughter for wanting to marry a man they hated. The second daughter had infuriated them by wearing revealing clothes and having secret boyfriends. The youngest girl had failed in school and tried to contact social workers to get her out of her troubled home. Shafia’s first wife had supported her daughters.</p> <p>For these so-called moral transgressions, the four females had to pay with their lives. The bodies of the three daughters—19-year-old Zainab, 17-year-old Sahar, and 13-year-old Geeti—and their mother, Rona Mohammad Amir, were found inside a family car that had plunged into a canal in 2009.</p> <p>Wiretapped conversations revealed that the murders were premeditated and cold-blooded. Acting on his father’s instructions, 20-year-old son Hamed used the family car to ram another car carrying the four women and push it into the canal.</p> <p>Exclusive interviews with CBC News revealed that the girls’ teachers had suspected there was trouble at home. The women’s relatives had also feared for their safety. Friends and relatives described how the three girls lived in constant fear of their controlling father.</p> <p>In 2012, a Canadian jury sentenced the three murderers to prison with no chance of parole for 25 years.</p> <h2>7 She Married A Man Of Her Choice</h2>  <p>Farzana Parveen, 25, was three months pregnant when she was publicly beaten to death outside a court of law in Lahore, Pakistan.
