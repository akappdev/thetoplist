And who else but Hollywood would ride yet another animal wave into money-making oblivion. Many movies have rats and mice in them, but few use them as the main characters playing both antagonist and protagonist. All but a couple here fit that category, and the others use them as an equally supportive role, but of no less importance. Here are ten films with our furry friends.</p> 10. Charlotte’s Web (1973) <p>Debbie Reynolds, Paul Lynde, and a young Danny Bonaducce supply their voices to a stellar animated feature based around the life, and, as it seems, impending death of a runty pig. Templeton steals the show in this, the superior original, as the gluttonous rat. The video I found is stills against a Sarah McLachlan tune.</p> <p>9. Stuart Little (1999)</p> <p>Geena Davis, Hugh Laurie, Michael J. Fox... oh, and the so-adorable-you-want-to-smack-him Johnathan Lipnicki fill out the cast for this animated-meets-live action comedy that really is pretty cute and quite family safe.</p> 8. Ben (1972) <p>“Where Willard ends, Ben begins” so states the film poster. Lee Montgomery befriends a rat named Ben and soon discovers his real roll as the leader of a crew of rogue rodents.</p> <p>7. Steamboat Willie (1928)</p> <p>The cartoon that launched the world’s most famous mouse into the stratosphere. Mickey is the pilot of a steamboat and must outwit Captain Pete in this 8 minute masterpiece.</p> <p>6. The Great Mouse Detective (1986)</p> <p>Vincent Price and Barrie Ingham supply voice talent to the animated feature loosely based on the Sherlock Holmes stories. Twists and turns, rescues, and a cliff-hanger finale really make this a Disney feature to see.</p> 5. Willard (2003) <p>I had to include the remake instead of the 1971 original with Ernest Borgnine because I truly believe that Crispin Glover is the most borderline insane and eccentric actor available today who could, and honestly does, pull off this witty re-imagining. Oh, and with R. Lee Ermey as his boss, you can’t go wring.</p> <p>4. The Rescuers (1977)</p> <p>Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor work for the Rescue Aid Society as two brave little mice. An adventure sends them deep into the swamps in search of a kidnapped little girl, Penny, as they enlist the assistance of shrews, rabbits, and a dragon fly named Evinrude. But it’s the diabolical kidnapper Geraldine Page who ultimately steals the show as the horrid Medusa. The music is as sad as it comes, as well.</p> <p>3. An American Tail (1986)</p> <p>When animator Don Bluth left Disney to begin his own studio in the early eighties, no one could have imagined he’d produce two of the most beloved movies still adored today. In this one, Feivel is separated from his Russian family as they begin to emigrate to the United States. His adventure leads to new friends, and many bumps and bruises along the way. Oh, and the song SOMEWHERE OUT THERE absolutely makes this 33-year old dude sob like a little girl.</p> <p>2. Ratatouille (2007)</p> <p>One of the most amazing films from the Disney/PIXAR library finds Remy the rat alone in Paris in search of a restaurant once ran by his idol. Patton Oswalt and Lou Romano as Remy and Linguini respectively give this kitchen caper all the life it needs as perhaps one of the finest films to take place in and around food.</p> <p>1. The Secret Of Nimh (1982)</p> <p>Wil Wheaton, Shannon Doherty, and Dom DeLouise use their amazing voice talents (the former of the trio basically unknown at the point) in this fabulous movie about Mrs. Brisby and her desperate need to relocate her home as the farm’s plow is about to till the land and destroy it. Rats, mice, a great owl, and a bumbling crow fill out the cast in this, Don Bluth’s first film outside of the Disney name. This movie is both beautiful and sad and truly makes you hope that little Timmy can get through pneumonia while his house is being uprooted. Great music, too.</p> <p>Notable omissions: Rats, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Graveyard Shift</p> <p>Contributor: StewWriter</p> </body></html>
