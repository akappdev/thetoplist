Every decade produces terrible horror movies and great horror movies, and this decade is no different. So I present here what are, to me, the very best horror movies since the year 2000.</p> <p></p> 15 <p>Ginger Snaps</p> <p>Directed by John Fawcett</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN86SzY5RCk&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>An underrated werewolf movie which brings to mind the classic Carrie, Ginger Snaps is a coming-of-age story with a difference. This movie doesn’t deliver many scares, but has a very good story line and is highly original in a genre starving for new ideas. Ginger Snaps isn’t for everyone but it is well worth a look.</p> <p>Buy this DVD at Amazon<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=jamifrat-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000A2X3U2"/></p> <p></p> 14 <p>Final Destination</p> <p>Directed by James Wong</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DD_MAz96L70&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>An original, fun, slasher-type movie, Final Destination delivers high on the gore, scares and plot twists and it all makes for a very entertaining way to spend and hour and a half of your afternoon.</p> <p>Buy this DVD at Amazon<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=jamifrat-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0780631684"/></p> <p></p> 13 <p>Saw</p> <p>Directed by James Wan</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFQebvkii90&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>Love it or hate it, Saw was original and brought horror back to today’s audiences. The horror industry today would not be the same without this film, and for that I place it at unlucky 13 of my list.</p> <p>Buy this DVD at Amazon<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=jamifrat-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0006SSOHC"/></p> <p></p> 12 <p>Frailty</p> <p>Directed by Bill Paxton</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IBGiPz0heI&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>I first noticed Bill Paxton in the vampire film Near Dark. He was by far the stand-out actor of that film. Little did I know how multi-talented he was. Here he directs a great little mystery thriller/horror with a fantastic script. He also does a brilliant job acting in it and we can expect great things from him in the future. Frailty had little box office success, but is a fantastic film. Do not pass it up.</p> <p>Buy this DVD at Amazon<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=jamifrat-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00006AUJR"/></p> <p></p> 11 <p>The Descent</p> <p>Directed by Neil Marshall</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mujk825LXk&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>The Descent is a film to watch with friends. The horror is a slow build up, and then suddenly you are immersed in it. It delivers high on the scares and has a great atmosphere. If you ever wanted to go cave diving, see this film... It might just change your mind.</p> <p>Buy this DVD at Amazon<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=jamifrat-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000IHY9TS"/></p>  10 <p>Hard Candy</p> <p>Directed by David Slade</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-C2H4ipxz0&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>In today’s anything-goes society it is hard to be controversial, extreme or shocking. Hard Candy is all three. It is the story of a 14 year old girl who meets Jeff, a 30 year old pedophile, at a cafe where she is invited to his home. Oh Jeff... What have you gotten yourself into. A superb performance from Ellen Page who would later become the fiery Juno, very well paced, full of plot twists and loaded with worthwhile social commentary. If you haven’t already seen this one, see it soon.</p> <p>Buy this DVD at Amazon<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=jamifrat-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000GI3KGC"/></p> <p></p> 9 <p>Gin Gwai (The Eye)</p> <p>Directed by The Pang Brothers</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2zef-v3gU&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>The Pang Brothers deliver a beautiful and chilling ghost story that would later be butchered by an American remake. The original is fantastic and I highly recommend it to fans of such films as The Sixth Sense and The Others, and any fan of J-Horror.</p> <p>Buy this DVD at Amazon<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=jamifrat-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0009S54WC"/></p>  8 <p>Session 9</p> <p>Directed by Brad Anderson</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsxkRNvEbhM&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>A chilling haunted house type story that is highly underrated. Brad Anderson, director of the amazing ‘The Machinist’, delivers a film to be watched alone and in the dark for maximum effect. It is one of the more unsettling films I have ever seen.</p> <p>Buy this DVD at Amazon<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=jamifrat-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00006AUIG"/></p> <p></p> 7 <p>28 Days Later</p> <p>Directed by Danny Boyle</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eunaclr-WgU&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>28 Days Later is one of the better ‘rapid-infection’ films out there. It has many scares, original ideas and is a feast for the eyes. Some of the scenes are simply breathtaking. I am assuming most people have seen this film, but if you haven’t, don’t put it off any longer.</p> <p>Buy this DVD at Amazon<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=jamifrat-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00005JMA8"/></p> <p></p> 6 <p>Ju-On (The Grudge)</p> <p>Directed by Takashi Shimizu</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8R1dODSbzU&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>In my mind, this is the scariest ghost film ever made. The sound the ghosts make unsettles me every time I think about it and it is a stand out in Asian horror. If you like long lasting, non-gory scares then this is the film for you.</p> <p>Buy this DVD at Amazon<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=jamifrat-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00005JNJR"/></p>  5 <p>Let The Right One In</p> <p>Directed by Thomas Alfredson</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ckdZpYVn38&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>I did not have very high hopes for this when I walked into the theater, but it is one of the most beautiful, touching and downright disturbing horror films I have ever seen. It is a future classic and I hope the Americans, with their upcoming remake, don’t butcher it. By the way, the current DVD release has dreadful subtitles. My advice is to put off buying it until they release the original theatrical subtitles for the film.</p> <p>Buy this DVD at Amazon<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=jamifrat-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B001MYIXAC"/></p> <p></p> 4 <p>Martyrs</p> <p>Directed by Pascal Laugier</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpDiQimK6U&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>This existential horror film is not for the faint of heart. It has lots of gore, many torture scenes and is absolutely relentless. It is also a deep and powerful film that keeps you glued to the screen and, at the same time, begging it to stop. There is about a plot twist every 5 minutes and if the first two sequences don’t get your heart racing, I don’t know what will.</p> <p>Buy this DVD at Amazon<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=jamifrat-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B001MEJY8W"/></p> <p></p> 3 <p>The Mist</p> <p>Directed by Frank Darabont</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-NF55EZ5tw&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>Was anyone expecting this film to be good? I mean, how good can a film be when it’s about monsters, with tentacle and claws galore, that live in a mysterious fog? The answer is very good and this is one of the standout films of this decade. The first 2/3rds of the film are fun, fast paced and tense, but it is the last third of this film that makes it one of the most horrible and horrifying horror movies ever made. The Mist gets a 10/10 from me and is a must-see for every horror fan.</p> <p>Buy this DVD at Amazon<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=jamifrat-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0010X745K"/></p> <p></p> 2 <p>[REC]</p> <p>Directed by Juame Balaguero &amp; Paco Plaza</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAnbWCjmOkA&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>[REC] is a zombie-type film that is actually scary. Indeed it is the only film of its kind that I find scary. The hand-held camcorder theme (ala The Blair With Project) is usually annoying, but it works really well in [REC]. It has a bizarre ending and is unforgiving and relentless. If you can get a copy, do so. Also, do not watch the terrible American remake ‘Quarantine’ first. [REC] is far superior and the American’s do not do justice to it.</p> <p>Buy this DVD at Amazon<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=jamifrat-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0028DRGDQ"/></p> <p></p> 1 <p>Inside</p> <p>Directed by Alexandre Bustillo &amp; Julien Maury</p> <p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldUsz12kSQU&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;]</p> <p>Inside is the standout film of the last 10 years to me. It is the only film that has ever had me trembling in my seat, yelling out loud at the screen, feeling physically ill and at the same time thoroughly enjoying it. Call me obsessive but I have seen this film 5 times now and it never disappoints. It is pretty short (only 80 minutes) and has some classic horror movie moments. It is well written, fantastically directed and beautifully acted and is the single most scary horror film I have ever seen. In terms of stylishness and directing expertise it reminds me of The Shining. Every self-respecting horror fan owes it to themselves to see this movie.</p> <p>Buy this DVD at Amazon<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=jamifrat-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000ZKQLU8"/></p>
